Its standout feature is a **carbon-aware flushing strategy** designed to reduce the environmental impact of its disk I/O operations.\r\n\r\nThis project was developed as part of a deep-dive exploration into Green Software Engineering principles, demonstrating how even foundational components like a storage engine can be made more environmentally conscious.\r\n\r\n## Quick Start\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Build the application\r\ngo build -o minibtreestore_app .\r\n\r\n# Run (Example with carbon-awareness enabled, high intensity start, and visualizer)\r\n./minibtreestore_app -carbonaware=true -mockhigh=true -inserts=500 -buffersize=2 -vizport=:8081 -dir=./test_run_data -interval=1s\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Interactive Carbon Intensity Control (During Run)\r\nWhen the application is running with `-carbonaware=true`:\r\n\r\nPress `L` (and Enter) in the terminal to set mock carbon emissions to LOW \ud83d\udfe2.\r\nPress `H` (and Enter) in the terminal to set mock carbon emissions to HIGH \ud83d\udd34.\r\n\r\n### Viewing the Frontend Visualizer\r\nAfter running the backend application with a `-vizport` specified (e.g., `:8081`):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Open this file in your web browser\r\nvisualizer/frontend/index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dashboard will poll data from `http://localhost:PORT/status` (e.g., `http://localhost:8081/status`).\r\n\r\n## \u2728 Features\r\n* **Core B+ Tree Operations:** Supports Insert, Lookup, and Scan operations. Delete functionality is also present.\r\n* **Buffer Management:** Implements a buffer manager with an LRU (Least Recently Used) page replacement policy to optimize disk access and improve performance.\r\n* **Carbon-Aware Flushing Strategy:**\r\n    * Monitors (simulated) grid carbon intensity (HIGH \ud83d\udd34 / LOW \ud83d\udfe2) using a `MockIntensityProvider`.\r\n    * Intelligently defers non-critical disk page flushes when carbon intensity is reported as HIGH.\r\n    * Processes the queue of deferred flushes when carbon intensity transitions to LOW, leveraging \"greener\" energy periods.\r\n    * Aims to reduce the effective CO2 footprint of disk write operations.\r\n* **Interactive Carbon Simulation:**\r\n    * Allows manual toggling of simulated carbon intensity (HIGH/LOW) during runtime via CLI input when `main.go` is running with carbon-awareness enabled.\r\n* **Real-time Visual Feedback:**\r\n    * **Enhanced CLI Logs:** Detailed console output with emojis (e.g., \ud83d\udfe1 Deferred, \ud83d\udfe2 Low Carbon Flush, \u2757Forced Flush) to track the system's carbon-aware decisions and actions.\r\n    * **Web Visualizer Dashboard:** A simple web-based dashboard (`visualizer/frontend/index.html`) polls a backend endpoint (`/status` from `visualizer/server.go`) to display:\r\n        * Current carbon intensity status.\r\n        * Size of the deferred flush queue.\r\n        * Counts of normal, deferred, and forced flushes.\r\n        * Buffer pool statistics.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcc2 Project Structure\r\n```\r\nminibtreestore/\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 carbonaware/             # Carbon intensity provider logic\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 intensity_provider.go\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 main.go                  # Main application entry point with CLI flags\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 storage/\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 btree/               # B+ Tree implementation\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 buffer/              # Buffer manager implementation\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 page/                # Page formats and constants\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 test/                    # Go tests (e.g., store_test.go)\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 util/\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 loader/              # CSV data loader utility (if used)\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 visualizer/\r\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 frontend/            # HTML, CSS, JS for the web dashboard\r\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 server.go            # Backend HTTP server for visualizer data\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\ude80 Getting Started (Detailed)\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n* Go (version 1.18 or higher recommended)\r\n\r\n### Build\r\nNavigate to the project root directory and run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngo build -o minibtreestore_app .\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Running\r\nThe application `main.go` serves as the entry point and accepts several flags to configure its behavior and the demo workload.\r\n\r\n**Key Command-Line Flags (see `main.go` for all):**\r\n\r\n* `-dir`: Storage directory for B-Tree files (default: `./minibtree_data`).\r\n* `-buffersize`: Number of pages in the buffer pool (default: 100). Try small values like 2 or 5 with high insert counts to observe buffer pressure.\r\n* `-carbonaware`: Enable carbon-aware mode (default: `false`).\r\n* `-carbonregion`: Carbon intensity region for simulation (default: `\"europe-west6\"`).\r\n* `-interval`: Interval for the carbon watchdog to check deferred queue (default: `30s`). Use shorter intervals like `1s` for faster demo feedback.\r\n* `-mockhigh`: Start with mock carbon intensity as HIGH (default: `false`, starts LOW).\r\n* `-vizport`: Port for the visualizer HTTP server (e.g., `:8081`). Set to empty to disable.\r\n* `-inserts`: Number of key-value pairs to insert for a demo workload.\r\n* `-btreename`: Name of the B-Tree for demo operations.\r\n\r\n**Example Run (from Quick Start):**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./minibtreestore_app -carbonaware=true -mockhigh=true -inserts=500 -buffersize=2 -vizport=:8081 -dir=./test_run_data -interval=1s\r\n```\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\uddea Testing\r\nThe `test/` directory contains Go tests (e.g., `store_test.go`). You can run these using standard Go test commands from the root directory:\r\n```bash\r\ngo test ./...\r\n```\r\nTo test the carbon-aware features interactively, use the command-line flags provided in `main.go` to set up different scenarios. The CLI logs and web visualizer are key to observing behavior. The \"Quick Start\" section above provides an example for running and interacting.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcdd Carbon-Aware Simulation Note\r\nThis project currently uses a `MockIntensityProvider` to simulate grid carbon intensity. This is essential for controlled testing and demonstration of the carbon-aware logic. Future work could involve integrating this with real-world carbon intensity data APIs (e.g., from the Green Software Foundation's Carbon Aware SDK, WattTime, Electricity Maps).\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n* Arka Mitra \r\n* Carmen Parra\r\n* Ismail Mohamed Mohamud\r\n* Jeffrey Koppanyi\r\n* Joe Romeo \r\n* Jonas Ward Van den Bulcke\r\n* Raunak Pillai\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT License\r\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/pillairaunak/carbonAwareDataStore","category_id":1,"category_name":"Build","contact_url":"https://github.com/pillairaunak/carbonAwareDataStore/issues","created_at":"2025-05-05T15:14","download_url":"https://github.com/pillairaunak/carbonAwareDataStore/releases","event_name":"Z\u00fcrich Green IT Hackathon","event_url":"https://climateaction.dribdat.cc/event/1","excerpt":" Your mission is to analyze, optimize, and advocate for energy-efficient open source software.

So we found a way to estimate how much CO<sub>2</sub> we produce while running our code.\n\n*How?*\n\nWe created a Python package that estimates your hardware electricity power consumption (GPU + CPU + RAM) and we apply to it the carbon intensity of the region where the computing is done.\n\n![calculation Summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlco2/codecarbon/master/docs/edit/images/calculation.png)\n\nWe explain more about this calculation in the [**Methodology**](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/methodology.html#) section of the documentation.\n\nOur hope is that this package will be used widely for estimating the carbon footprint of computing, and for establishing best practices with regards to the disclosure and reduction of this footprint.\n\n**So ready to \"change the world one run at a time\"? Let's start with a very quick set up.**\n\n# Quickstart \ud83d\ude80\n\n## Installation \ud83d\udd27\n\n**From PyPI repository**\n```python\npip install codecarbon\n```\n\n**From Conda repository**\n```python\nconda install -c codecarbon codecarbon\n```\nTo see more installation options please refer to the documentation: [**Installation**](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/installation.html#)\n\n## Start to estimate your impact \ud83d\udccf\n\nTo get an experiment_id enter:\n```python\n! codecarbon init\n```\nYou can now store it in a **.codecarbon.config** at the root of your project \n```python\n[codecarbon]\nlog_level = DEBUG\nsave_to_api = True\nexperiment_id = 2bcbcbb8-850d-4692-af0d-76f6f36d79b2 #the experiment_id you get with init\n```\nNow you have 2 main options:\n\n### Monitoring your machine \ud83d\udcbb\n\nIn your command prompt use:\n```codecarbon monitor```\nThe package will track your emissions independently from your code.\n\n### In your Python code \ud83d\udc0d\n```python\nfrom codecarbon import track_emissions\n@track_emissions()\ndef your_function_to_track():\n  # your code\n  ```\nThe package will track the emissions generated by the execution of your function.\n\nThere is other ways to use **codecarbon** package, please refer to the documentation to learn more about it:  [**Usage**](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/usage.html#)\n\n## Visualize \ud83d\udcca\n\nYou can now visualize your experiment emissions on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.codecarbon.io/).\n![dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlco2/codecarbon/master/docs/edit/images/dashboard.png)\n\n*Note that for now, all emissions data send to codecarbon API are public.*\n\n> Hope you enjoy your first steps monitoring your carbon computing impact!\n> Thanks to the incredible codecarbon community \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc a lot more options are available using *codecarbon* including:\n> - offline mode\n> - cloud mode\n> - comet integration...\n>\n> Please explore the [**Documentation**](https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon) to learn about it\n> If ever what your are looking for is not yet implemented, let us know through the *issues* and even better become one of our \ud83e\uddb8\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddb8\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f contributors! more info \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\n\n\n# Contributing \ud83e\udd1d\n\nWe are hoping that the open-source community will help us edit the code and make it better!\n\nYou are welcome to open issues, even suggest solutions and better still contribute the fix/improvement!
