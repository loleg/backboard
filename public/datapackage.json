This has led to encounters with foreign lands, their inhabitants, their customs, their flora and fauna. Cultural heritage collections are full of artifacts resulting from and bearing witness to those people \u201con the move\u201d: archival records, travel reports, audiovisual documents, object collections, oral histories etc. These artifacts weave an invisible web between people and places, between events and stories being told about them, between heritage collections and scholars, and between the people of every generation making sense of them \u2013 through artistic creation, through the (de-)construction of collective memories, or by exploiting them in the pursuit of political or economic interests.\r\n\r\nThe thematic focus is intended as a source of inspiration; hackathon participants are free to work on other topics related to cultural heritage. \r\n\r\nGLAMhack24 will be held under a friendly space policy, ensuring a positive and inclusive environment for all participants.

We need your expertise to bring these connections to life!\r\n\r\n##### **Your Mission:**\r\n\r\nDive into Keller-Escher\u2019s genealogical data and help identify and connect the individuals recorded in this work to biographical databases like VIAF, GND, and others. Then, take these connections and create Linked Open Data (LOD) to visualize the complex web of relationships that bind Z\u00fcrich\u2019s historic families together.\r\n\r\n##### **What We're Looking For:**\r\n\r\n1. **Prompt Engineers and coders:** Using artificial intelligence, we will try to extract and structure data describing persons mentioned in the transcribed data. To this end, your task will be to find prompts for the AI to structure the data as best as possible. Some experience with ChatGPT is all you need to help.\r\n2. **Historical Detectives:** We need participants with a knack for research and a passion for history to identify the individuals in Keller-Escher\u2019s work. You\u2019ll search for biographical data from various sources, such as VIAF and GND, and match these with the names recorded in the genealogy.\r\n3. **Data Integrators & Creators:** Once the historical detectives have identified the persons, we need participants skilled in data modeling and creation to produce Linked Open Data (LOD). Your task will be to create and structure the data, linking these individuals and their relationships in a way that can be easily visualized and explored.\r\n4. **Visualization Experts:** Help us transform the structured genealogical data into engaging visualizations. By mapping out relationships and family trees, you'll make it easier for researchers and the public to explore the rich genealogical and social history of Z\u00fcrich.\r\n\r\n##### **Why Participate?**\r\n\r\n* Bring History to Life: Contribute to creating a living, interconnected web of Z\u00fcrich\u2019s past, making it accessible and understandable to everyone.\r\n* Learn and Innovate: Gain hands-on experience with historical data, Linked Open Data (LOD), and advanced visualization techniques, all while working on a meaningful project.\r\n* Collaborate and Connect: Work alongside a passionate team of historians, data scientists, and visualization experts, building connections that could lead to future opportunities.\r\n\r\nJoin us in this challenge to illuminate Z\u00fcrich\u2019s genealogical and social history and create tools that help exploring the past!\r\n\r\n### Link to our data set:\r\n\r\nhttps://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/promptuarium-genealogicum-des-carl-keller-escher\r\n\r\n#### Etherpad:\r\n\r\nhttps://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/GLAMhack24\\_Keller-Escher\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/magnetilo/carl-escher-promptuarium](https://github.com/magnetilo/carl-escher-promptuarium)","maintainer":"tim_rudiger","name":"Unraveling Z\u00fcrich\u2019s social and family networks in Keller-Escher's \"Promptuarium\"","phase":"Sketching","progress":20,"score":80,"source_url":"https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/GLAMhack24_Keller-Escher","stats":{"commits":60,"during":75,"people":4,"sizepitch":3399,"sizetotal":3827,"total":87,"updates":82},"summary":"GLAMhack2024 project for creating family relations graph","team":"tim_rudiger, thilo_weber, waddell, piloublan","team_count":4,"updated_at":"2024-09-07T13:36","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/224","webpage_url":"https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11595/YW37ALX3QLSH6JLZVHKFOCZY/final_simple_pdf_with_large_title.pdf"},{"autotext":"# Wiglitcher App\n\nFor GLAMhack 2024..\n\nTo run the app:\n\nCreate a `.env` file and put the **Personal key** that you made on [Wikimedia API](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:AppManagement) in there like this:\n\n```\nWIKIMEDIA_TOKEN=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ...\n```\n\nThen you can:\n\n```\nflet run [app_directory]\n```","autotext_url":"https://github.com/snappy91/Wiglitcher","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://github.com/snappy91/Wiglitcher/issues","created_at":"2024-07-10T14:34","download_url":"https://wiglitcher.openglam.ch/","event_name":"GLAMhack 2024","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/12","excerpt":"To support investigation into the provenance of open cultural content, our challenge was to gamify data collection in Wikimedia - in particular, to decide the extent (e.g. a non-binary rating) to which an image is synthetic or generative in origin.

See *Challenge Notes* below for further details.\r\n\r\n# GLAMhack 2024 Project\r\n\r\nWe started with brainstorming options, developing a sensible mission statement, and planning the work in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com):\r\n\r\n![Writing out our goals in Excalidraw](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/H91LF3VLUPC4U2VRF7VMW9H1/Screenshot_from_20240906_171459.png)\r\n\r\nIn the [shared Etherpad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/glamhack24-perceptual) we are collecting links to tools and resources.\r\n\r\n![Design thinking tool](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/M8RK6J601ENNPORY68BMQWXW/Unbenannt202409061717.svg)\r\n\r\nUsing a slightly adapted version of the [WHY-NOW-HOW](https://gamestorming.com/how-now-wow-matrix/) matrix, our features were quickly prioritized.\r\n\r\n![Photo of a sketch](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/Q46YV6MEXJ4BWLH2O4Z96VSN/1000025726.jpg)\r\n\r\nPen and paper usually works best for nailing down a sketch (we went through a few iterations ..) with a vision that we can commit to.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Wikiguess game](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/YYLBGSRU6MDZHINPAANOWLVI/Screenshot_20240906134651.png)\r\n\r\nWe discovered [WikiGuess by ComputerCow](https://computercow.itch.io/wikiguess): a simple yet delightful game about guessing real/fake Wikipedia titles that helped us to test out our concept.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of app](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/QL0FHJRSTSVNPKMAWO2ZRBZ6/Screenshot_from_20240909_092121.jpg)\r\n\r\nThen we set up a [Flet/Python app](https://flet.dev) open source project to flesh this out a bit more, and shared this in GitHub. More screenshots are in presentation slides and details of how to run it are in the README section below. Due to an [open bug](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/3783) we have not yet been able to publish the prototype.\r\n\r\n![ComfyUI screenshot](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/DUTNUZGH57VFPEUSPZUGNELG/comfyui.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we looked into how an AI evaluation or enhancement could be plugged into our app. Selecting several open source machine learning models, and testing them in the [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) framework, we were able to demonstrate the potential of these techniques. Our model parameters are shared in this [Switch drive folder](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/rB5dhQRR1m1DzUL). The workflow was deployed on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), but we did not have time to connect the API.\r\n\r\n![Wikipedia draft](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/ZG87TDM2NCSWNUY3HFZ6TRT3/Screenshot_from_20240909_092844.png)\r\n\r\nFinally, a Wikipedia article on the topic of our challenge \"[Perceptual Plausibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Perceptual_Plausibility)\" has been drafted, and we came up with the name **Wiglitcher** for our app (a portmanteau of Wiki and Glitch). A link on neuropsychological research on the topic [\"Reality Bending\" ](https://realitybending.github.io/publication/) may lead you to more interesting exploration of the topic!\r\n\r\nThanks to absolutely everyone at the hackathon, especially to the [Pimp my portrait gallery](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/212) team at the next table for their valuable support and collaboration.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Challenge Notes\r\n\r\nAs a dataset for this project, we propose to compile and curate additional media from artists in the [municipality of K\u00f6niz](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Koeniz_Schloss.jpg#/media/File:Koeniz_Schloss.jpg), where a [culture festival is being run](https://kulturfestkoeniz.ch/kulturschaffende) in parallel to this year's GLAMhack. In addition to the 100+ existing [Wikimedia Commons entries](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=k%C3%B6niz&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image) we can source additional materials to upload. We can then generate an equal amount of images using [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) (with [Community License](https://stability.ai/news/license-update)) close to the subject matter of the Commons collection. Some of these images will be \"uncanny\", making it hard to decide their origins. The complete collection will be provided as a [Data Package](https://datapackage.org) in open formats. A game could be prototyped with an open source framework used for [citizen science](https://eu-citizen.science/platforms/) (e.g. [PyBossa](https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa)) and inspired by other crowdsourcing projects (e.g. StreetComplete).\r\n\r\nThe output of this challenge should be a [concept sketch](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mocks_for_Wikidata_Tagging_game,_version_a.png), a prototype, or even playable game, that can engage the public and contribute to the debate on *Perceptual Plausibility* outlined below.\r\n\r\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369199434/figure/fig6/AS:11431281194360492@1696040262062/The-Depiction-Wikidatagame_W640.jpg)\r\n\r\n*Screenshot of the Depiction Wikidata game, [Sigalov and Nachmias 2023](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-11664-1)*\r\n\r\nThe GLAM community is at the heart of academic and critical debate on the use of machine learning (ML) in creative domains. Whether generating text, images, sounds, video, or 3D metaverses, we explore the multimedia advances and [augmentative potential](https://www.wildbuilt.world/p/ai-co-created-tools) of artificial intelligence (AI) with active interest and critical reflection on the impact to society.\r\n\r\nWith ML and AI now built into illustration tools, photocameras, and other recording devices, it may be argued that the lines of what is or what is not \"generative\" are indeed increasingly blurry. One aspect of this discussion that we might agree on as designers or critics alike, is that [Perceptual Plausibility](https://www.frontiersin.org/search?query=perception+plausibility&tab=top-results&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Fjournals%2Fvirtual-reality%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffrvir.2022.914392%2Ffull) \\- such as photo\\-realism\\, in the case of images \\- is an important differentiating factor\\. See the [History of Text-to-image models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model#History) and [Uncanny Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) for further references on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nThere are [numerous tools](https://github.com/ai-detected/ai-content-detectors?tab=readme-ov-file) and even [ML-based benchmarks](https://fdmas.github.io/AIGCDetect/) to test the generative provenance of uploaded content, with varying levels of accuracy and applicability. We even see increasing use of adversarial techniques like [Nightshade](https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html). The [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) begs the question of whether determining plausibility (realism) as a human observer or moderator will be possible for much longer. See also: [Stable Diffusion and Why It Matters](https://hackaday.com/2022/09/06/stable-diffusion-and-why-it-matters/) and [Evaluating Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/conceptual/evaluation).\r\n\r\nHere is an excerpt of the recently posted official guidance on [Commons:AI-generated media](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:AI-generated_media) states:\r\n\r\n> *Per the Commons project scope, only media that are realistically useful for an educational purpose should be hosted on Commons. Just because an AI image is interesting, pretty, or looks like a work of art, that doesn't mean that it is necessarily within the scope of Commons. While some AI-generated media fall within our scope, media that lack a realistic educational use may be nominated for deletion.*\r\n\r\nThe legal discussion, a confusing cornucopia of legislative debates on AI and copyright around the world related to this, was neatly summed up last October by Creative Commons in [Understanding CC Licenses and Generative AI](https://creativecommons.org/2023/08/18/understanding-cc-licenses-and-generative-ai/):\r\n\r\n> *We encourage the use of CC0 for those works that do not involve a significant degree of human creativity, to clarify the intellectual property status of the work and to ensure the public domain grows and thrives. ... Neither copyright nor CC licenses can or should address all of the ways that AI might impact people. There are no easy solutions, but it is clear we need to step outside of copyright to work together on governance, regulatory frameworks, societal norms, and many other mechanisms to enable us to harness AI technologies and practices for good.*\r\n\r\nIn terms of content labelling, there have been several initiatives in this community:\r\n\r\n* [How should AI-generated media be handled?](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:AI-generated_media#How_should_AI-generated_media_be_handled?) section of the Guidance mentioned above;\r\n* [Category:AI-generated images by Commons users](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:AI-generated_images_by_Commons_users);\r\n* [Wikimedia Commons AI/Essay](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons_AI/Essay), part of a rejected [Proposal for a sister project](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons_AI) (similar to [WikiAI](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiAI));\r\n* [AI Sauna/AI for Wikimedia Commons](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AI_Sauna/AI_for_Wikimedia_Commons) at a recent community event;\r\n\r\nRecently the [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) video sharing platform, an [early adopter](https://www.heise.de/news/Vimeo-integriert-Creative-Commons-Lizenzen-1037536.html) of CC licenses, [announced](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/vimeos-position-on-ai) new [AI guidelines](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/25551485186833-How-do-I-label-my-videos-to-indicate-they-contain-AI-generated-content), along with a revised [Terms of Service](https://vimeo.com/terms).\r\n\r\n![](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/article_attachments/26477014687505)\r\n\r\n*Image: [Vimeo Help Center](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/25551485186833-How-do-I-label-my-videos-to-indicate-they-contain-AI-generated-content)*\r\n\r\nA project like this one could also be used to explore critical questions about the way online gigs and microtasking is used for building AI datasets: see [Inside the AI Factory](https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots), and [Are CAPTCHAs used to to train AI?](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-captcha-and-does-google-use-it-to-train-ai)\r\n\r\n![](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/1/071R5NQZFM0DWMTHGU1LEB9J/69316_The_tennis_player_is_Roger_Federer_Swiss_tennis_s_xl1024v10.jpg)\r\n\r\n*This image, and the one in the header, were rendered using Stable DIffusion XL 1.0.*\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to leave a [Comment](215/comment) here with any further links.","maintainer":"loleg","name":"Perceptual Plausibility","phase":"Prototype","progress":30,"score":68,"source_url":"https://github.com/snappy91/Wiglitcher","stats":{"commits":23,"during":39,"people":3,"sizepitch":11203,"sizetotal":12032,"total":53,"updates":49},"summary":"Build a game for classifying images as plausible (human-created) or implausible (machine-generated), that could also be \"played\" by an autonomous agent in order to automatically discern the provenance of content in a GLAM context, such as the images or other content shared on Wikimedia Commons.

Newly developed search features have opened up new possibilities for reuse of Europeana's database. One of those features is the **geospatial search feature**, which allows users to specify a point in space and search within a certain radius around that point. The Search API will return all objects in its database that fall within that search radius and conform to the other query parameters the user has entered. An example of this kind of search is:\r\n\r\n[https://api.europeana.eu/record/search.json?wskey=YOURAPIKEY&query=*&qf=distance(coverageLocation,47,12,2000)&sort=distance%20asc](https://api.europeana.eu/record/search.json?wskey=api2demo&query=*&qf=distance(coverageLocation,47,12,2000)&sort=distance%20asc)\r\n\r\nMore than 17 million Europeana objects are enriched with a latitude and longitude position in one or more of the following fields: *currentLocation*, *coverageLocation* or *location*. More information can be found here: [https://europeana.atlassian.net/browse/EA-2996](https://europeana.atlassian.net/browse/EA-2996)\r\n\r\n![twinitscreenshot.png](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11586/0LQVYTZHYYC5739MSFCWVYBS/twinitscreenshot.png)\r\n\r\n*an example of geographical storytelling: a screenshot of the [Twin It! Humap website](https://twin-it.humap.site/map/browse), which shows which 3D models each member state has submitted.*\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**THE CHALLENGE**\r\n\r\nWe at Europeana challenge you to **create a project that in some way leverages the geospatial search feature for storytelling purposes**. What shape this project takes is up to you: you can trace a single object or person throughout history on a map, you might create an app that allows users to search for objects close to their current physical location, or anything else that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nBecause this years' theme is 'On the Move', please think about a project that falls within those parameters. One audience group that loves engaging with cultural heritage in a geo-specific setting is tourists. If your project can **solve an issue the tourism sector has** (e.g. 'what are interesting places near me to visit?' or 'how can I know more about this thing I've just found?') using digital cultural heritage, you're appealing to a huge audience. An interesting subset of our collection to explore for glamhack24 is our Migration Collection. It consists of over 300K cultural heritage objects and can be accessed by using the query parameter 'theme=migration' in the Search API. [example API call](https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?wskey=YOURKEY&query=*&profile=standard&theme=migration).\r\n\r\nAre you looking for more inspiration on what content in Europeana you can reuse to appeal to the theme 'On the Move'? Then check out our stories tagged with 'migration': [https://www.europeana.eu/en/stories?tags=migration](https://www.europeana.eu/en/stories?tags=migration)\r\n\r\nOne of the ways you can nicely visualise your data is by using [Humap](https://humap.me/).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**GET IN TOUCH**\r\n\r\nYou'll be supported during this challenge by Jolan Wuyts, API Outreach coordinator at Europeana, who can help you understand our APIs, curate API calls for you and generally be a mentor and expert on the Europeana database. The rest is up to you and the rest of the team!\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Documentation details**\r\n\r\nYou can find the docs for the europeana Search API here: [https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2385739812/Search+API+Documentation](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2385739812/Search+API+Documentation)\r\n\r\nBelow is an extract from those docs detailing how to use the `distance`, `location`, `CurrentLocation`, `CoverageLocation`, and location sorting parameters:\r\n\r\nWe can filter results by distance using the function `distance` in the parameter `qf`. This example will look for objects with the words `world war` that are located (the object itself or the spatial topic of the resource) in a `distance` of `200` km to the point with latitude `47` and longitude `12`.\r\n\r\nSyntax: `query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)`\r\n\r\n`https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)`\r\n\r\nWe can also use more specific fields instead of `location`: `currentLocation` (with coordinates from `edm:currentLocation`), and `coverageLocation` (with coordinates from `dcterms:spatial` and `dc:coverage`). For example, `qf=distance(currentLocation,47,12,200)` will filter the results to those located within 200 km of the coordinates indicated.\r\n\r\nWhen we refine by distance (i.e., `qf=distance(...)`), we can also include `distance+asc` or `distance+desc` in the sorting parameter in order to rank the results by the distance to the coordinates.\r\n\r\nSyntax: `query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)&sort=distance+asc`\r\n\r\n`https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)&sort=distance+asc`\r\n\r\nRefinement and sorting parameters can be concatenated. Each such parameter and the mandatory query parameter contributes a breadcrumb object if breadcrumbs are specified in the search profile.\r\n\r\nmore information about the specific content of fields like dcterms:spatial, edm:currentLocation and dc:coverage can be found here: [https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2106294284/edm+ProvidedCHO](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2106294284/edm+ProvidedCHO)\r\n\r\n![IMG 20240907 150912.jpg](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11586/4G06OZR27L58OBCXGHVF2L6D/IMG_20240907_150912.jpg)","maintainer":"jolanwuyts","name":"Getting creative with Europeana","phase":"Sketching","progress":20,"score":52,"source_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pyvHCVLt7LFaxAyxRU2gIesMeJF_p-ocSqHQtUwpTZw/edit?usp=sharing","stats":{"commits":0,"during":15,"people":5,"sizepitch":6214,"sizetotal":6662,"total":36,"updates":30},"summary":"Create a project that leverages the Europeana Search API's new 'distance' search parameter for storytelling purposes.

One of the objects was an unspectacular lump of corroded bronze that proved to be the remains of the world's first known analog computer built in Ancient Greece. The so-called Antikythera Mechanism was a hand-powered model of the solar system used to calculate astronomical cycles and to predict eclipses.\r\n\r\n![1280pxMecanismo de Anticitera 2.JPG](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/5/P34BJKNM1NRIFR5NUJXZ199A/1280pxMecanismo_de_Anticitera_2.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Dials**\r\n\r\n82 individual parts of the Antikythera mechanism have survived, seven large fragments, known as fragments A to G, and 75 smaller fragments, which were simply numbered from 1 to 75. All parts of the mechanism were cut out of a 1 to 2 mm thick bronze sheet. The entire mechanism was originally packed in a wooden frame or box. The extensive and still ongoing reconstruction of the mechanism revealed that it served as a model for the movements of the Sun, the Moon and the planets as observable from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe front of the mechanism contains one large dial. Above and below the dial it contained a so-called parapegma \u2013 a list with the dates of heliacal risings and settings of important stars and constellations. The base of the front dial is a solar calendar. Two ring-shaped scales are part of the dial, an inner zodiac scale and an outer date scale. The inner ring scale was divided into 12 sections for the 12 signs of the zodiac. The outer ring scale was divided into 365 sections for the 365 days of the year according to the Egyptian calendar: 12 months of 30 days each and 5 additional days. The movement of the Sun, the Moon and the 5 planets known at the time \u2013 Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn \u2013 were visualised on the front. The current position of the celestial bodies in the zodiac at a certain point in time could be read off on the front dial. Additionally, the front contained a sphere, which illustrated the current phase of the moon.\r\n\r\n![scales.jpg](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/5/JK4TYSPVOHQBT7ZM97VEXJ8D/scales.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe back of the mechanism contains two large and three small dials. The basic unit of the two large back dials is the synodic lunar month. The upper large spiral-shaped dial is a lunar calendar which was scaled with the 13 month names of a lunisolar calendar used at the time. When the sun pointer on the front was turned 19 times (19 solar years), 235 synodic months were traversed on the back. This astronomical connection between 19 solar years which equal 235 synodic months with good precision is known as the Metonic cycle. The large upper dial encompasses two smaller dials. The existence of the one on the left side is backed by the discovery of the number 76 in the inscriptions. This led to the assumption that this refers to the 76-solar-year Callippic cycle. The Callippic cycle consists of four Metonic cycles, after which one day had to be skipped in order to realign the solar and lunar time-keeping. The upper right dial is the so-called games dial. It contains the names of several important pan-hellenic feasts such as the Olympiads and of some smaller local ones within a four-year cycle.\r\n\r\nThe lower large spiral-shaped dial on the back is an eclipse calendar which was scaled with 223 synodic lunar months, the so-called Saros period. After 223 synodic lunar months eclipses repeat under similar circumstances. The synodic months in which a solar eclipse and/or a lunar eclipse took place were marked with glyphs. In the current reconstruction the large lower dial encompasses one smaller dial. It is tightly connected with the eclipse calendar \u2013 it extends the eclipse calendar to three times the value of the Saros period. One Saros period has a surplus of about eight hours. After three Saros periods \u2013 one Triple-Saros or Exeligmos \u2013 this surplus adds up to 24 hours and thus one full day. The small Exeligmos dial was divided into three sectors, which indicated whether the time of day indicated on the main scale applied, or whether 1/3 or 2/3 days were to be added.\r\n\r\n**Project**\r\n\r\nThe Antikythera Mechanism project @ https://www.thomasweibel.ch/antikythera/ was a challenge entry for the 10th Swiss Open Cultural Data Hackathon taking place on Sept 6/7 in Lucerne. It aims at providing an accurate and freely accessible VR model for education and study porposes. The project visualizes the mechanism according to the actual findings in the existing fragments, despite plausible speculations proposing additional gearwork also visualizing the movements of the five planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) known at the time.\r\n\r\nThe VR model can be downloaded <a href=\"https://www.thomasweibel.ch/antikythera/antikythera-mechanism4.min.glb\">here</a> (GLB format, 42MB) and viewed <a href=\"https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n**Sources**\r\n\r\n* Almagest, International Journal for the History of Scientific Ideas 2016.1: The Inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism ([https://www.brepolsonline.net/toc/almagest/2016/7/1](https://www.brepolsonline.net/toc/almagest/2016/7/1))\r\n* Aristeidis, V., Christophoros, M., & Andreas, V.

But more designers and programmers are also very welcome, of course. :)\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Implementation\r\n\r\nWe would implement the project as a website, because the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) and [MediaDevices API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices) are good enough.","maintainer":"dorian_zgraggen","name":"Randomly Wandering Around","phase":"Research","progress":10,"score":30,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":6,"people":6,"sizepitch":2163,"sizetotal":2228,"total":20,"updates":13},"summary":"Find the locations of various old photos and paintings in Lucerne","team":"dorian_zgraggen, lea_martin, juli\u00e1n_rodriguez_ugolini, PiaGemperle, ihar_shchetko, SelinaOdermatt","team_count":6,"updated_at":"2024-09-13T21:57","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/227","webpage_url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xOrByt_pqCd9voxaqECR7APH9AnJNzHz?usp=share_link"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2024-08-15T12:48","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2024","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/12","excerpt":"**First Success:**\r\nWe figured out OpenRefine, wikidata and wikimedia commons together to upload the first three images for the Ethnographic Museum of the UZH:\r\n[Photographs by Antoin Sevruguin in the Ethnografic Museum UZH](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs_by_Antoin_Sevruguin_in_the_collection_of_V%C3%B6lkerkundemuseum_der_Universit%C3%A4t_Z%C3%BCrich)\r\n![AntoinSevruguinMadchenineuropaischerundMadcheninpersischerKleidungnebeneinandersitzendMuseumRietberg2022.00428.134.jpg...","hashtag":"@Lesesaal","id":220,"ident":"03","image_url":"","is_challenge":false,"is_webembed":true,"logo_color":"","logo_icon":"","longtext":"**First Success:**\r\nWe figured out OpenRefine, wikidata and wikimedia commons together to upload the first three images for the Ethnographic Museum of the UZH:\r\n[Photographs by Antoin Sevruguin in the Ethnografic Museum UZH](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs_by_Antoin_Sevruguin_in_the_collection_of_V%C3%B6lkerkundemuseum_der_Universit%C3%A4t_Z%C3%BCrich)\r\n![AntoinSevruguinMadchenineuropaischerundMadcheninpersischerKleidungnebeneinandersitzendMuseumRietberg2022.00428.134.jpg](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11486/8KRI0UVTPU02JSM2AQ4WRDQA/AntoinSevruguinMadchenineuropaischerundMadcheninpersischerKleidungnebeneinandersitzendMuseumRietberg2022.00428.134.jpg)\r\n\r\nTwo girls in European Persian dress, Antoin Sevruguin (1851-1933), Iran, c. 1880-1896, albumen print, 11.8 \u00d7 16.8 cm, Museum Rietberg Zurich, Emil Alpiger Collection, inv. no. 2022.428.134, gift from the heirs of Emil Alpiger. Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons.\r\n\r\nAntoin Sevruguin (1851\u20131933) was born to Armenian parents in Iran, he grew up in Tiflis (now Tbilisi), Georgia, and later worked in Tehran. His goal was to make a portrait of his native country that was as comprehensive as possible. His oeuvre included around 7,000 photographs. During his lifetime, his photographs were already being published in European books; he was awarded gold medals in Brussels and Paris and in 1900 raised to the nobility by the shah in 1900. Artists in Iran still relate to him today. Many museum all around the world have photographs by Sevruguin in their collections. In Zurich the Ethnografic Museum UZH and the Museum Rietberg each have several albums with a few hundred photographs.\r\n\r\nIn this challenge we want to discover how images from collections can be made accessible on the wikiverse: Together we will find out, what tools can be used and what the best practices are. Maybe we are even putting together a cheat sheet for GLAM institutions or write up detailed instruction? We further explore the use of the images on wikipedia.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is mostly aimed at people from GLAM institutions without an IT background who are interested in how to make their collections accessible through the wikiverse.

([https://n2t.net/ark:/63274/bz1wc85](https://n2t.net/ark:/63274/bz1wc85))*\r\n\r\nThe history of glass plate photography dates back to the mid-19th century when it was introduced as a more durable and higher quality alternative to paper negatives. Coated with light-sensitive emulsions and exposed in cameras, glass plates produced detailed and sharp images, revolutionizing photography by allowing for greater precision and clarity. However, the process was labor-intensive and required careful handling of the fragile glass plates.\r\n\r\n**Glassplattensammlung Zug**\r\n\r\nThe Bibliothek Zug houses over 3600 of these plates, known as the \"Glasplattensammlung Zug.\" This collection captures a diverse array of scenes, including architectural landmarks, scenic landscapes, and everyday life moments. Due to the fragility of these glass plates and their archival confinement, presenting these captivating photographs to the public was a significant challenge in the past.\u00a0Utilizing advanced digitization techniques, the Bibliothek Zug partnered with Memoriav to digitize the collection and georeference approximately 2500 photographs from the late 19th century to the 1950s. About half of these images were taken in the Canton of Zug, with a notable concentration in and around the city of Zug.\r\n\r\n**Challenge**\r\n\r\nWith the [photos accessible on the Zentralgut website](https://zentralgut.ch/glasplatten_zug/), the Bibliothek Zug aims to bring the collection to a broader audience through the development of a mobile app. This app will notify users when they are near a location where one of the georeferenced photos from the \"Glasplattensammlung Zug\" was taken, offering a unique and immersive way to explore the region's history. This app provides a look into the past, allowing users to compare historical life and architecture with the present-day, offering a distinctive perspective on Zug's evolution over time.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 20240907 150309 Firefox.jpg](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11476/6EJXBSBHOMTI40D0ITGALXEV/Screenshot_20240907_150309_Firefox.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 20240907 150317 Firefox.jpg](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11476/N7IQ6M2PG07D6JSM96GEVU6J/Screenshot_20240907_150317_Firefox.jpg)","maintainer":"","name":"GeoPhoto App","phase":"Project","progress":5,"score":26,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":15,"people":4,"sizepitch":3577,"sizetotal":3763,"total":21,"updates":17},"summary":"Develop a mobile application that displays georeferenced photos from the 'Glasplattensammlung Zug' to the user when they are in close proximity to the location where the photo was taken.","team":"Joel_Z, NadiaChristen, liowalter, jonas_baumann","team_count":4,"updated_at":"2024-09-07T14:39","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/211","webpage_url":"https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11611/GG8GYM5Z5FOGNUDZ3ZHKUR5Q/glamhack20248v2.pdf"},{"autotext":"# Challenge 14 \"Unveiling the Secrets of Zurich\u2019s Nightly Visitors (1780-1818)\"  /GLAMhack 2024 \r\n\r\nThis Repo contains the JPG-images from [Z\u00fcrcher Nachtzedel (1780-1784)](https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/zurcher-nachtzedel/resource/222e9a5f-5dfe-4918-8e73-62da5573a4bb) and an OCR example with Claude 3.5 on Colaboratory. \r\n\r\n## Contents \r\n- \"ideas\" folder contains;\r\n    - Python-Notebook for OCR with Claude 3.5\r\n    - OCR results in txt format (in the folder \"ocr_mit_claude\")\r\n    - Text contents in TEI/XML format (in the folder \"tei_beispiele\")\r\n- \"images\" folder contains;\r\n    - images from Z\u00fcrcher Nachtzedel (1780-1784).

De Saussure realized that the blue value reflects the amount of water (or pollution) in the air: The bluer the sky, the less vapor or particles, the whiter, the more. De Saussure applied the shades of blue with watercolor to a total of 52 strips of paper, which he glued to a wooden or cardboard ring, from white, which de Saussure labeled \"0\", through all shades of blue to black which had the value \"52\". The deepest blue de Saussure measured himself was 39 degrees on the summit of Mont Blanc in 1787.\r\n\r\nThe instrument itself seems simple, but its sophistication lies in the calibration leading to a set of equidistant color shades. De Saussure used to give away self-made cyanometers to scientist friends whom he encouraged to measure the blue of the sky in as many different places of the world as possible. In fact, young Alexander von Humboldt carried such a cyanometer with him in 1802 when he climbed the 6263-metre-high Chimborazo in Ecuador, which was considered the highest mountain on earth at the time. When von Humboldt reached the summit the weather cleared, revealing the darkest blue ever measured up to that point: 46 degrees on the cyanometer.\r\n\r\nThe Cyanometer project @ https://www.thomasweibel.ch/cyanometer/ provides a freely available copy of the instrument.\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n\r\nLaunch Cyanometer on your smartphone and grant access to the camera. Turn away from the sun, point the center to the sky and adjust the color using the red slider. The number indicates the current shade of blue. A normal, clear midday sky at sea level will be around 23 degrees.\r\n\r\n**Sources**\r\n\r\n* Barry, R. G. (1978). H.-B. de Saussure: the first mountain meteorologist.

In a next step, this project could be extended to Mexican institutions, before extending it to institutions in further countries. Reaching out to the different museums and convincing them to open up their collections requires a long-term outreach effort that is ideally coupled with a GLAM hackathon, a university class, or a Wikipedia edit-a-thon, in order to provide the institutions with concrete examples of data reuse. Ideally, a broader form of cooperation with the museums that goes beyond the mere publication of data evolves over time.</p><p></p><p>In the context of the Swiss GLAMhack, we are looking for Swiss partner institutions who are willing to support us in our endeavor. </p><p></p><p>To spur the creation of artistic projects based on Mexico-related heritage collections in Switzerland, Opendata.ch has teamed up with BUAP.\u00a0Together, we have implemented a novel method (termed <a class=\"c10\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O4v9JlqqgFXckBBSgmRO9RGPeGyHqAcqia8IkJe1Hoo/edit&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726062863842995&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OQcRfRq6PFFQ8HkN9yVIp\">\u201cCultureFLOW\u201d</a>) for the facilitation of artistic creative processes that engage with collective memories, in the form both of heritage artifacts and of living memories.

In this section, we summarize the insights gathered in the course of the Swiss pilot project in 2024, with a focus on ethnographic collections<sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]</a></sup>. With regard to some aspects, earlier experiences with natural history collections are taken into account as well.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfC-BGMIb6Dgxp5bVEJoSTnH0gY-QtcTyTvwJhBKOtG7JQsR2Pa1ZLahux4y7eBC2tLyH6AdaQteYP9-qyMmzLe6BjgbcYszEG3BmJ42ZFGQd-UT2JghR4Mbibc3NvihLx2sJU-jogwrDemFTdcNg?key=1AF-xhcaiDKJKJn3irs_eg\"></p><p>Figure 1: Making Collections\u00a0Accessible Online in Three Phases</p><p></p><h2 id=\"h.ot8tb4y10964\">Phase 1: Laying the Foundations</h2><p>There are two important first steps that need to be accomplished before collections can be made available online: </p><p></p><ol><li>Existing collection catalogs, finding aids, etc. need to be digitized. In some cases, a central collection catalog will need to be created from scratch, based on existing documents or the physical organization of the collection (no. 1 in the figure).</li></ol><p>Best Practice:Digitize existing (analog) catalogs in order to be able to link the entries in the digital catalog to earlier versions of the catalog (sources). Example:\u00a0<a class=\"c10\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ville-ge.ch/meg/sql/musinfo_public.php?id%3DK002091&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726062863845837&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pKpOxcZPgKwXDtTRJ8f3i\">Collection catalog of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019ethnographie de Gen\u00e8ve</a>\u00a0(see the links to the historical catalogs at the bottom of the page).</p><p></p><p></p><ol><li>Given the fact that catalogs of ethnographic collections often contain only very little information about the artifacts and the information available may be of dubious quality, it is important to provide photographs of collection artifacts alongside the catalog information. Consequently, existing photographs need to be digitized or new photographs need to be taken (no. 2).</li></ol><p></p><p>Best Practice:</p><p></p><p>When taking new photographs of artifacts, make sure to secure sufficient usage rights to the photographs to (later) be able to release the high-resolution images online under a free copyright license.(provide a sample contract\u2026)\u00a0</p><p></p><h2 id=\"h.12xrmw8xngf2\">Phase 2: Facilitating Access</h2><p>An important next step is to make the collection catalog available online (no. 3). Depending on the maturity level of the database, this can be done in various forms. As a rule, it is more useful to make the existing catalog available online now than to wait until it can be done in the perfect format .</p><p></p><p>Thus, for example, the publication of the catalog in PDF format as an intermediate solution (example: <a class=\"c10\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mkb.ch/en/museum/sammlung/bestandeslisten.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726062863847408&amp;usg=AOvVaw1uVceA334wlqkzKMVizaAR\">Inventory Lists of Museum der Kulturen Basel</a>) provides for better online access than would the decision not to publish exports from the current collection database and to wait for the acquisition and roll-out of an online collection database instead.</p><p></p><p>Best Practices:</p><p></p><ul><li>Provide images alongside the text information contained in the collection database.</li><li>The images should have the highest resolution (legally) possible, in order to maximize their usefulness.</li><li>The entry for each artifact should have its own persistent identifier; persistent identifiers should be dereferenceable (i.e. an URI consisting of a standard path and the persistent identifier should return the description of the artifact in the online catalog). </li><li>Artifacts should be findable in the collection database when a user enters the persistent identifier in the search interface.</li><li>The landing page of the catalog should be referenced in Wikidata by means of a P8768 (online catalog URL) statement.\u00a0 </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>In addition, the institution should signal its readiness to respond to and to engage with potential re-users of the data. This can be done by different means, e.g.:</p><p></p><ul><li>Indicate an address and a method by which high-resolution images of collection artifacts can be obtained and ensure an efficient process for doing so.</li><li>Advertise the catalog and digital images in the context of hackathons to encourage their re-use.</li><li>Advertise the catalog, digital images, and further information about the collection in the context of a Wikipedia edit-a-thon.</li></ul><p>Best Practices:</p><p></p><ul><li>Provide pointers to competent experts that can provide potential re-users of the data with additional information about the collection or individual artifacts.</li></ul><p></p><p>Example Case: Mus\u00e9e d\u2019ethnographie de Gen\u00e8ve </p><h2 id=\"h.8ynkroqeexav\">Phase 3: Facilitating Re-use</h2><p>Re-use of data and digitized artifacts can be facilitated using several strategies:</p><p></p><ol><li>If the rights situation (copyright, personal rights, collective rights of the communities concerned) allows for it, digitized artifacts should be made available online under a free copyright license in the highest quality possible.

Many tourists but also many locals do not know that there used to be a third wooden footbridge called Hofbr\u00fccke, built in the 13th century. It was the longest of the three bridges and was adorned with framed triangular paintings like the other two. The paintings on the Hofbr\u00fccke depict events from the Old and New Testament of the Bible. The Hofbr\u00fccke connected the city with the collegiate church of St. Leodegar, the Hofkirche. When the bridge was demolished in the 19th century, the paintings were stored in magazines or used as art objects in public buildings. After the fire on the Kapellbr\u00fccke in 1993, the city of Lucerne took backup photographs of the Hofbr\u00fccke paintings. Some paintings are no longer traceable. The numbers attached to the images belong to image inventories created at different times by different people. The differences in numbering can therefore be explained by different cycle interpretations.\r\n\r\n**Challenge**\r\n\r\nThe City Archives of Lucerne invites you to help create a virtual tour where people can experience a walk on the Hofbr\u00fccke with its paintings, the view over the city, the lake and the alpine panorama. For this simulation, you can use the photographs of the paintings, which are accessible on the ZentralGut website: [Br\u00fcckenbilder Hofbr\u00fccke - ZentralGut](https://zentralgut.ch/Brueckenbilder_Hofbruecke_Luzern/). A picture gallery with paintings and constructional drawings of the bridge and its immediate surroundings is on the website of the City Archives of Lucerne: [Stadt Luzern - Zeitlicher Br\u00fcckenschlag: Virtueller Gang \u00fcber die Hofbr\u00fccke](https://www.stadtluzern.ch/dokumentebilder/bildergalerien/detail/43246). These pictures shall help visualising where the bridge was located, how it looked, and how it integrated into the cityscape.","maintainer":"","name":" Stroll on a Demolished Medieval Wooden Bridge","phase":"Challenge","progress":0,"score":2,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":0,"people":2,"sizepitch":2257,"sizetotal":2303,"total":8,"updates":6},"summary":"Create a virtual walking tour on the Hofbr\u00fccke","team":"PiaGemperle, SelinaOdermatt","team_count":2,"updated_at":"2024-09-05T19:56","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/216","webpage_url":"https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11594/AVDA3W5O7VFD7WCEQ8QK6I2G/Pr\u00e4sentation_Hofbr\u00fccke.pdf"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2024-09-02T06:28","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2024","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/12","excerpt":"Stiftung f\u00fcr Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte (SKKG) in Winterthur has a collection of about 300 crossbows from Switzerland, Germany, other Europen countries, and worldwide.
