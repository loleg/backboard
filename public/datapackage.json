In our [presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/main/presentation/When_do_Balance_Energy_Prices_Skyrocket_13_09_2024.pdf) you can see the key outputs, or browse our notebooks and other sources shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/).\r\n\r\nThe goal is better understanding of the subject matter through clear presentation of the data. Our **[data sources](#data)**, as well as further **[literature and links](#notes)** that were referenced can be found in a section further on.\r\n\r\nAn initial Energy Overview was done by combining outputs from five energy sources with data available for this year:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/main/presentation/Combined.png)\r\n\r\n**Comparison of Share and Price of Tertiary Energy**\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/main/presentation/Tertiary_energy_share.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Comparison of Amount and Price of Tertiary Energy**\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/main/presentation/Tertiary_energy.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Energy Overview**\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/main/presentation/Energy_overview.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe started mocking up a basic dashboard using [Marimo](https://marimo.io), which could include further read-outs and interactive graphs.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/main/presentation/Marimo_iterating.png)\r\n\r\nPrediction of load levels was done with [Chronos forecasting](https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting?tab=readme-ov-file) running in a [Runpod](https://runpod.io/?ref=yqg82xxd), as shown here: \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/main/presentation/Chronos.png)\r\n\r\nWe also ran tests in the [SARIMAX](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_sarimax_stata.html#) and [Nixtla](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast?tab=readme-ov-file) forecasting libraries.\r\n\r\nFinally, a [Timeline of April 22 events](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=18jdhZQgIdU4FcwuW5Rif82PitmR3abKi2VNdCQOxnnY&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650) was started by collecting key developments in a spreadsheet. \r\n\r\nWe thank all the participants of the Hackdays, and hope that we provoke further data exploration in the future!\r\n\r\n# Data\r\n\r\n| Dataset | File | Source |\r\n| ------- | ---- | ------ |\r\n| Day-ahead prices, hourly | auction\\_spot\\_prices\\_switzerland\\_2024.csv | EPEX |\r\n| Day-ahead traded volumes, hourly | auction\\_spot\\_volumes\\_switzerland\\_2024.csv | EPEX |\r\n| Balancing prices for BGs short/long, 15min | balancing\\_prices\\_2024.csv | Swissgrid |\r\n| Day-ahead prices, hourly | day\\_ahead\\_prices\\_CH\\_2024.csv | ENTSO-E |\r\n| Swiss power generation per type, hourly | generation\\_per\\_type.csv | ENTSO-E |\r\n| Swiss power generation per type (staging), hourly | generation\\_per\\_type\\_staging.csv | ENTSO-E |\r\n| Yearly calendar of events | kalender\\_2024\\_ch.csv | - |\r\n| Legend of Meteoschweiz columns | legende meteoschweiz.csv | Meteoschweiz |\r\n| Consumption schedule, hourly | load.csv | ENTSO-E |\r\n| Consumption Schedule (staging), hourly | load\\_staging.csv | ENTSO-E |\r\n| Weather data | staging\\_ms\\_6120.csv | Meteoschweiz |\r\n| Weather data (unprocessed) | staging\\_ms\\_6121.csv | Meteoschweiz |\r\n| Problems reported in power supply | unavailability\\_of\\_generation\\_units.csv | ENTSO-E |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nJoin our [Data Expedition](https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/15) to help efforts to catalog and support open data for projects like this one.

To learn about pricing models for power trading, see this [With The Grid blog post](https://withthegrid.com/energy-pricing-epex-day-ahead-and-imbalance-prices/).\r\n\r\nSwissgrid has to pay the current balancing price, and there is little to counter speculation and mispredictions. Few understand the background about the schedules and how Swissgrid organizes the grid operation. The [Swissgrid website](https://www.swissgrid.ch/de/home/customers/topics/bgm/balance-energy.html) has various documents that illustrate the matter.\r\n\r\nFor a brief intro to statistical forecasting with Python, see [SARIMAX at Statsmodels.org](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/notebooks/generated/statespace_sarimax_faq.html)\r\n\r\n## In the Media\r\n\r\nThese articles on the events in April were mentioned in the Challenge presentation:\r\n\r\n- [NZZ 30.04.2024](https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/fehlprognose-beim-solarstrom-ploetzlich-fehlte-der-schweiz-die-produktion-eines-grossen-kernkraftwerkes-ld.1828058)\r\n- [NZZ 16.05.2024](https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/wie-angespannt-ist-die-lage-am-strommarkt-ld.1697374)\r\n- [Bluewin 30.04.2024](https://www.bluewin.ch/de/news/schweiz/schweiz-drohte-letzte-woche-ploetzlich-ein-strom-blackout-2185652.html)\r\n- [Infosperber 13.05.2024](https://www.infosperber.ch/umwelt/energieproduktion/der-fast-blackout-den-es-nicht-gab/)\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\nWe found these prior Hackday and other projects inspirational:\r\n\r\n- [Visistrom (2019)](https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/27)\r\n- [Electricity Maps (2020)](https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/67)\r\n- [Trends in tertiary energy prices (2021)](https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/86)\r\n- [Experimental Statistics ML_SoSi BFS (2023)](https://www.experimental.bfs.admin.ch/expstat/de/home/projekte/ml-sosi.html)\r\n- [F\u00fcllungsgrad der Speicherseen BFE (2024)](https://www.uvek-gis.admin.ch/BFE/storymaps/AP_FuellungsgradSpeicherseen/?lang=de)\r\n- [DataHub - Brent and WTI Spot Prices](https://datahub.io/@Daniellappv/oil-prices-this)\r\n- [UK Energy Dashboard](https://www.energydashboard.co.uk/live) ([Source](https://github.com/1tang/Energy-Dashboard), [Data](https://www.nationalgrideso.com/data-portal))\r\n- [Visualization of the European transmission network with Plotly and the PyPSA-Eur package](https://github.com/zoltanmaric/coppersushi)\r\n\r\n## Simulation as Game\r\n\r\nInspired by Koboldgames, who supported [previous Energy Hackdays](https://koboldgames.ch/blog/2021-01-13?lang=eng) and have developed [serious games](https://koboldgames.ch/games) involving environmental and economics models, we researched whether games are being used to simulate and teach power systems.\r\n\r\n- [Barrios-O\u2019Neill, Hook](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001632871630088X) (2016)\r\n- [Fate of the World](https://store.steampowered.com/app/901776/Fate_of_the_World_Tipping_Point/) (2011)\r\n- [Green with Energy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/890890/Green_With_Energy/) (2024)\r\n- [How video games prepared me for energy modelling](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-video-games-prepared-me-energy-modelling-10-avgerinopoulos/) (LinkedIn)\r\n\r\nWe used [Etherpad](https://pad.okfn.de/) (hosted at OKFN DE) to collaborate on these notes.\r\n","autotext_url":"https://github.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://github.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/issues","created_at":"2024-08-22T09:58","download_url":"https://github.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/releases","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2024","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/8","excerpt":"https://youtu.be/vhdChUOw8x4?t=5610\r\n\r\nThe original [challenge is here](https://github.com/SFOE-Hackathons/EnergyDataHackdays2024-BalanceEnergyPrices/blob/main/CHALLENGE.md).

As a result, at least a thousand of different electricity tariffs exist in Switzerland, a detailed overview of which does not exist. Elcom hosts a website, where the end customers can compare their tariffs to similar tariffs at other municipalities in Switzerland, however this comparison is a rather rough one, relying on average prices for high and low tariffs and on very specific (and rather unrealistic) assumptions about the electricity consumption of each customer type ([Strompreise Schweiz (admin.ch)](https://www.strompreis.elcom.admin.ch/)). Thus, the end customers cannot have an exact comparison of their electricity bill with other locations and energy companies do not have the exact data to test new products and services (electric mobility, battery storage etc.) and to perform the exact financial modelling needed for them to decide on where it is more profitable to operate and what to charge.\r\n\r\nHere's a list of possible benefits of precise electricity tariffs per energy provider in Switzerland:\r\n\r\nElectromobility:\r\n\r\n* Cost savings: Allows EV users to charge during cheaper periods.\r\n* Promotes EV adoption: Attractive tariffs for off-peak charging.\r\n\r\nEnergy Efficiency:\r\n\r\n* Optimized consumption: Encourages shifting energy use to lower-cost periods.\r\n* Supports efficient appliances: Incentivizes using energy-efficient devices.\r\n\r\nRenewable Energy:\r\n\r\n* Boosts self-consumption: Favors users with solar panels to maximize self-produced energy.\r\n* Better integration: Optimizes use of solar/wind power.\r\n\r\nGrid Stability:\r\n\r\n* Demand shifting: Reduces peak demand, enhancing grid stability.\r\n* Demand response: Enables participation in grid relief programs.\r\n\r\nCustomer Satisfaction:\r\n\r\n* Personalized tariffs: Tailored to individual consumption, increasing satisfaction.\r\n* Transparency: Offers better control over energy costs.\r\n\r\nCompetitive Advantage:\r\n\r\n* Market differentiation: Innovative tariffs set providers apart.\r\n* Customer acquisition: Attracts new customers with clear, attractive tariffs.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Impact:\r\n\r\n* CO2 reduction: Encourages renewable energy use and reduces peak consumption.\r\n* Sustainable practices: Incentivizes eco-friendly behavior.\r\n\r\nFlexible Pricing:\r\n\r\n* Time-based tariffs: Aligns consumption with lower-cost periods.\r\n\r\nDynamic pricing:\r\n\r\n* Reflects real-time market conditions.\r\n\r\n**How**\r\n\r\n* Data: The different tariffs can be found in PDF format on the Elcom website and are openly available on the Elcom website. Feel free to use your imagination to access further potentially valuable information online via web-scrapping\r\n* Solution: Use openAI models (or do you have a better idea?) to get the correct information (we can start with the x biggest utilitites in Switzerland and build it up from there).\r\n* Frontend (optionally): Provide a frontend for easy comparison of electricity prices in different regions and across different years in Switzerland\r\n\r\n**Benefits**\r\n\r\n* Gain hands-on experience with the openAI API and test the LLM technology \u2013 worth it or hype debunked?\r\n* Learn about the different electricity tariffs and provide a fresh look into tariff differences across regions\r\n\r\n**Requirements**\r\n\r\n* Coding skills (Python and/or Javascript preferred, others welcomed)\r\n* First experiences with GenAI and writing prompts\r\n* Creative thinking \u2013 let\u2019s prototype\r\n\r\n**Links**\r\n\r\n* Repository: [https://github.com/geoimpact/electricity-tariffs](https://github.com/geoimpact/electricity-tariffs)\r\n* Key (encrypted): U2FsdGVkX1/e3dQHsSUfAtb1NqrtQfxriv5mT+UVXm808t4b3d2S/g+sMIYSj0hmRcv6byYw/N8tU938I12RYDWWxFuP/EIVuPxThADCw6X8IRaVce8EG4/N0dGPHtDhqNO/NIuQIeEfYzy3Z/GylhM2mgraoh5Ok77Dvro+od1RWe92mnD5sH9jbpcgGiLyjXQtMe1ifAEzqFA6BVGV03MCkOGfe1SRTYSygOUU20TkFxuyVK0TOhL4dyxH9sfB\r\n* Project Coordination: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kzSg2NGnhJ7JnRw92oTBIT9yq9eGEWVUAH4OQuudQIs/edit\r\n\r\n**Contact**\r\n\r\nEKZ und GeoImpact, Angelos Selviaridis (EKZ) and David Suter (GeoImpact)\r\n\r\n![qrcode.png](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/openenergydata/245/AHF0CNGGQ6TW2QD5US14JXBM/qrcode.png)\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n","maintainer":"","name":"Watts & Bots: Energizing Swiss Tariff Transparency with AI","phase":"Prototype","progress":30,"score":53,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":13,"people":12,"sizepitch":4961,"sizetotal":4961,"total":26,"updates":13},"summary":"","team":"lukas_mona, angelos_selviaridis, ggcaponetto, shushi_luo, michael_mazourik, maurice_sifrig, stefano_spadaccia, tom_strosslin, marina_gonzlez_vay, mathias_niffeler, davidsuter, patrick_ploesser","team_count":12,"updated_at":"2024-09-15T18:34","url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/123","webpage_url":"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/openenergydata/203/MUI8ZXHMF9TOA266XJ4BPPOR/Watts__Bots_Energizing_Swiss_Tariff_Transperency_with_AI.pptx____Schreibgesch\u00fctzt.pdf"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2024-08-09T07:46","download_url":"https://energy-hackday-ch4.wundrig.ch/","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2024","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/8","excerpt":"In many households, the potential for energy efficiency often goes unrealized.

As the energy landscape evolves rapidly with increasing renewable energy sources, predicting and ensuring grid stability becomes more challenging. Renewables like wind and solar power are variable and less predictable compared to traditional power plants, and the electrification of sectors like transport and heating further complicates power flow predictability. To manage grid stability, ancillary services such as aFRR are crucial, as they provide quick adjustments to electricity supply or demand. By predicting aFRR activations, we can better manage and schedule assets, identify potential market opportunities, and ensure grid reliability in the face of an evolving energy landscape. Predicting aFRR activation calls is particularly challenging, especially when simulating scenarios for the future up to 2050. This challenge aims to determine if the fundamental input and output data of a typical electricity price forecasting model can also be used to predict daily aFRR activation volumes.\r\n\r\n**How**\r\n\r\n**Participants will**\r\n\r\n* Data Access: Receive curated datasets containing historical records of aFRR activation calls (both positive and negative) in Switzerland for the years 2018 to 2023 and files containing potential input features. The datasets will be pre-processed and include key contextual factors relevant to the challenge.\r\n* Model Development: Develop predictive models using statistical and machine learning algorithms to predict daily aFRR activation volumes. Emphasize model simplicity and interpretability. Ideally, the model should provide not only a point estimate for daily aFRR call-off quantities but also a probability distribution for these quantities. Models will be evaluated on a test dataset from the year 2024.\r\n* Scenario Evaluation: Consider how future trends, such as increased renewable energy adoption, climate change, and reduced fossil fuel usage, might influence aFRR activation volumes. Visualize assumptions and findings.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**\r\n\r\n* By participating in this challenge, you will gain hands-on experience in predictive modelling, data analysis, and the practical application of their work to real-world energy grid stability issues within a short timeframe.\r\n* You support grid operators and energy companies in forecasting future grid stability. In this way, you will help to better quantify the costs of expanding renewables and, at the same time, identify potential market opportunities for flexible power plants or storage systems (e.g. utility-scale batteries).\r\n* Establish contacts with BKW's flexibility and market analysis teams.\r\n\r\n**Contact**\r\n\r\nJill Huber, Fabian Gottschlich, Tom Felder (BKW AG)","maintainer":"","name":"Predicting Control Energy Volumes for Grid Stability ","phase":"Prototype","progress":30,"score":48,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":10,"people":8,"sizepitch":3375,"sizetotal":3375,"total":14,"updates":5},"summary":"","team":"brice_repond, remo_steiner, rob_mills, raphael_vogt, lea_bchlin, jill_huber, fabian_gottschlich, solt_kovacs","team_count":8,"updated_at":"2024-09-15T18:35","url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/project/118","webpage_url":"https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/openenergydata/233/ZPUDTUTNKXDEXG84AKTTM2ZI/Predicting_Control_Energy_Volumes_for_Grid_Stability.pdf"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2024-09-02T06:28","download_url":"","event_name":"Energy Data Hackdays 2024","event_url":"https://hack.energy.opendata.ch/event/8","excerpt":"District heating networks provide heat to buildings through a network of underground pipes.

Additionally, we aim to incorporate sample household consumption data and explore how this individual data correlates with the overall grid pattern. The goal is to provide end-users with insights into their contribution to grid peaks (which can lead to higher costs) or their ability to consume anti-cyclically to help reduce peak costs.\r\n\r\n## Data\r\n\r\nThe hardware setup includes a Janitza power meter that will be connected to a local server, capturing data via Modbus and storing it in InfluxDB.
