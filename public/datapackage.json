This has led to encounters with foreign lands, their inhabitants, their customs, their flora and fauna. Cultural heritage collections are full of artifacts resulting from and bearing witness to those people \u201con the move\u201d: archival records, travel reports, audiovisual documents, object collections, oral histories etc. These artifacts weave an invisible web between people and places, between events and stories being told about them, between heritage collections and scholars, and between the people of every generation making sense of them \u2013 through artistic creation, through the (de-)construction of collective memories, or by exploiting them in the pursuit of political or economic interests.\r\n\r\nThe thematic focus is intended as a source of inspiration; hackathon participants are free to work on other topics related to cultural heritage. \r\n\r\nGLAMhack24 will be held under a friendly space policy, ensuring a positive and inclusive environment for all participants. This policy emphasizes respect and prohibits harassment based on gender, sexual orientation, disability, appearance, race, religion, or any other characteristic. Attendees are expected to comply with these guidelines to maintain a welcoming and constructive atmosphere throughout the event.

We need your expertise to bring these connections to life!\r\n\r\n##### **Your Mission:**\r\n\r\nDive into Keller-Escher\u2019s genealogical data and help identify and connect the individuals recorded in this work to biographical databases like VIAF, GND, and others. Then, take these connections and create Linked Open Data (LOD) to visualize the complex web of relationships that bind Z\u00fcrich\u2019s historic families together.\r\n\r\n##### **What We're Looking For:**\r\n\r\n1. **Prompt Engineers and coders:** Using artificial intelligence, we will try to extract and structure data describing persons mentioned in the transcribed data. To this end, your task will be to find prompts for the AI to structure the data as best as possible. Some experience with ChatGPT is all you need to help.\r\n2. **Historical Detectives:** We need participants with a knack for research and a passion for history to identify the individuals in Keller-Escher\u2019s work. You\u2019ll search for biographical data from various sources, such as VIAF and GND, and match these with the names recorded in the genealogy.\r\n3. **Data Integrators & Creators:** Once the historical detectives have identified the persons, we need participants skilled in data modeling and creation to produce Linked Open Data (LOD). Your task will be to create and structure the data, linking these individuals and their relationships in a way that can be easily visualized and explored.\r\n4. **Visualization Experts:** Help us transform the structured genealogical data into engaging visualizations. By mapping out relationships and family trees, you'll make it easier for researchers and the public to explore the rich genealogical and social history of Z\u00fcrich.\r\n\r\n##### **Why Participate?**\r\n\r\n* Bring History to Life: Contribute to creating a living, interconnected web of Z\u00fcrich\u2019s past, making it accessible and understandable to everyone.\r\n* Learn and Innovate: Gain hands-on experience with historical data, Linked Open Data (LOD), and advanced visualization techniques, all while working on a meaningful project.\r\n* Collaborate and Connect: Work alongside a passionate team of historians, data scientists, and visualization experts, building connections that could lead to future opportunities.\r\n\r\nJoin us in this challenge to illuminate Z\u00fcrich\u2019s genealogical and social history and create tools that help exploring the past!\r\n\r\n### Link to our data set:\r\n\r\nhttps://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/promptuarium-genealogicum-des-carl-keller-escher\r\n\r\n#### Etherpad:\r\n\r\nhttps://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/GLAMhack24\\_Keller-Escher\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/magnetilo/carl-escher-promptuarium](https://github.com/magnetilo/carl-escher-promptuarium)","maintainer":"tim_rudiger","name":"Unraveling Z\u00fcrich\u2019s social and family networks in Keller-Escher's \"Promptuarium\"","phase":"Sketching","progress":20,"score":80,"source_url":"https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/GLAMhack24_Keller-Escher","stats":{"commits":60,"during":75,"people":4,"sizepitch":3399,"sizetotal":3827,"total":87,"updates":82},"summary":"GLAMhack2024 project for creating family relations graph","team":"tim_rudiger, thilo_weber, waddell, piloublan","team_count":4,"updated_at":"2024-09-07T13:36","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/224","webpage_url":"https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11595/YW37ALX3QLSH6JLZVHKFOCZY/final_simple_pdf_with_large_title.pdf"},{"autotext":"# Wiglitcher App\n\nFor GLAMhack 2024..\n\nTo run the app:\n\nCreate a `.env` file and put the **Personal key** that you made on [Wikimedia API](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:AppManagement) in there like this:\n\n```\nWIKIMEDIA_TOKEN=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ...\n```\n\nThen you can:\n\n```\nflet run [app_directory]\n```","autotext_url":"https://github.com/snappy91/Wiglitcher","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"https://github.com/snappy91/Wiglitcher/issues","created_at":"2024-07-10T14:34","download_url":"https://wiglitcher.openglam.ch/","event_name":"GLAMhack 2024","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/12","excerpt":"To support investigation into the provenance of open cultural content, our challenge was to gamify data collection in Wikimedia - in particular, to decide the extent (e.g. a non-binary rating) to which an image is synthetic or generative in origin.

See *Challenge Notes* below for further details.\r\n\r\n# GLAMhack 2024 Project\r\n\r\nWe started with brainstorming options, developing a sensible mission statement, and planning the work in [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com):\r\n\r\n![Writing out our goals in Excalidraw](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/H91LF3VLUPC4U2VRF7VMW9H1/Screenshot_from_20240906_171459.png)\r\n\r\nIn the [shared Etherpad](https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/glamhack24-perceptual) we are collecting links to tools and resources.\r\n\r\n![Design thinking tool](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/M8RK6J601ENNPORY68BMQWXW/Unbenannt202409061717.svg)\r\n\r\nUsing a slightly adapted version of the [WHY-NOW-HOW](https://gamestorming.com/how-now-wow-matrix/) matrix, our features were quickly prioritized.\r\n\r\n![Photo of a sketch](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/Q46YV6MEXJ4BWLH2O4Z96VSN/1000025726.jpg)\r\n\r\nPen and paper usually works best for nailing down a sketch (we went through a few iterations ..) with a vision that we can commit to.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Wikiguess game](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/YYLBGSRU6MDZHINPAANOWLVI/Screenshot_20240906134651.png)\r\n\r\nWe discovered [WikiGuess by ComputerCow](https://computercow.itch.io/wikiguess): a simple yet delightful game about guessing real/fake Wikipedia titles that helped us to test out our concept.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of app](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/QL0FHJRSTSVNPKMAWO2ZRBZ6/Screenshot_from_20240909_092121.jpg)\r\n\r\nThen we set up a [Flet/Python app](https://flet.dev) open source project to flesh this out a bit more, and shared this in GitHub. More screenshots are in presentation slides and details of how to run it are in the README section below. Due to an [open bug](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/issues/3783) we have not yet been able to publish the prototype.\r\n\r\n![ComfyUI screenshot](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/DUTNUZGH57VFPEUSPZUGNELG/comfyui.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn parallel, we looked into how an AI evaluation or enhancement could be plugged into our app. Selecting several open source machine learning models, and testing them in the [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) framework, we were able to demonstrate the potential of these techniques. Our model parameters are shared in this [Switch drive folder](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/rB5dhQRR1m1DzUL). The workflow was deployed on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), but we did not have time to connect the API.\r\n\r\n![Wikipedia draft](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/1/ZG87TDM2NCSWNUY3HFZ6TRT3/Screenshot_from_20240909_092844.png)\r\n\r\nFinally, a Wikipedia article on the topic of our challenge \"[Perceptual Plausibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Perceptual_Plausibility)\" has been drafted, and we came up with the name **Wiglitcher** for our app (a portmanteau of Wiki and Glitch). A link on neuropsychological research on the topic [\"Reality Bending\" ](https://realitybending.github.io/publication/) may lead you to more interesting exploration of the topic!\r\n\r\nThanks to absolutely everyone at the hackathon, especially to the [Pimp my portrait gallery](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/212) team at the next table for their valuable support and collaboration.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n# Challenge Notes\r\n\r\nAs a dataset for this project, we propose to compile and curate additional media from artists in the [municipality of K\u00f6niz](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Koeniz_Schloss.jpg#/media/File:Koeniz_Schloss.jpg), where a [culture festival is being run](https://kulturfestkoeniz.ch/kulturschaffende) in parallel to this year's GLAMhack. In addition to the 100+ existing [Wikimedia Commons entries](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=k%C3%B6niz&title=Special:MediaSearch&go=Go&type=image) we can source additional materials to upload. We can then generate an equal amount of images using [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) (with [Community License](https://stability.ai/news/license-update)) close to the subject matter of the Commons collection. Some of these images will be \"uncanny\", making it hard to decide their origins. The complete collection will be provided as a [Data Package](https://datapackage.org) in open formats. A game could be prototyped with an open source framework used for [citizen science](https://eu-citizen.science/platforms/) (e.g. [PyBossa](https://github.com/Scifabric/pybossa)) and inspired by other crowdsourcing projects (e.g. StreetComplete).\r\n\r\nThe output of this challenge should be a [concept sketch](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mocks_for_Wikidata_Tagging_game,_version_a.png), a prototype, or even playable game, that can engage the public and contribute to the debate on *Perceptual Plausibility* outlined below.\r\n\r\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369199434/figure/fig6/AS:11431281194360492@1696040262062/The-Depiction-Wikidatagame_W640.jpg)\r\n\r\n*Screenshot of the Depiction Wikidata game, [Sigalov and Nachmias 2023](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10639-023-11664-1)*\r\n\r\nThe GLAM community is at the heart of academic and critical debate on the use of machine learning (ML) in creative domains. Whether generating text, images, sounds, video, or 3D metaverses, we explore the multimedia advances and [augmentative potential](https://www.wildbuilt.world/p/ai-co-created-tools) of artificial intelligence (AI) with active interest and critical reflection on the impact to society.\r\n\r\nWith ML and AI now built into illustration tools, photocameras, and other recording devices, it may be argued that the lines of what is or what is not \"generative\" are indeed increasingly blurry. One aspect of this discussion that we might agree on as designers or critics alike, is that [Perceptual Plausibility](https://www.frontiersin.org/search?query=perception+plausibility&tab=top-results&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.frontiersin.org%2Fjournals%2Fvirtual-reality%2Farticles%2F10.3389%2Ffrvir.2022.914392%2Ffull) \\- such as photo\\-realism\\, in the case of images \\- is an important differentiating factor\\. See the [History of Text-to-image models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model#History) and [Uncanny Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) for further references on Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nThere are [numerous tools](https://github.com/ai-detected/ai-content-detectors?tab=readme-ov-file) and even [ML-based benchmarks](https://fdmas.github.io/AIGCDetect/) to test the generative provenance of uploaded content, with varying levels of accuracy and applicability. We even see increasing use of adversarial techniques like [Nightshade](https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html). The [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) begs the question of whether determining plausibility (realism) as a human observer or moderator will be possible for much longer. See also: [Stable Diffusion and Why It Matters](https://hackaday.com/2022/09/06/stable-diffusion-and-why-it-matters/) and [Evaluating Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/conceptual/evaluation).\r\n\r\nHere is an excerpt of the recently posted official guidance on [Commons:AI-generated media](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:AI-generated_media) states:\r\n\r\n> *Per the Commons project scope, only media that are realistically useful for an educational purpose should be hosted on Commons. Just because an AI image is interesting, pretty, or looks like a work of art, that doesn't mean that it is necessarily within the scope of Commons. While some AI-generated media fall within our scope, media that lack a realistic educational use may be nominated for deletion.*\r\n\r\nThe legal discussion, a confusing cornucopia of legislative debates on AI and copyright around the world related to this, was neatly summed up last October by Creative Commons in [Understanding CC Licenses and Generative AI](https://creativecommons.org/2023/08/18/understanding-cc-licenses-and-generative-ai/):\r\n\r\n> *We encourage the use of CC0 for those works that do not involve a significant degree of human creativity, to clarify the intellectual property status of the work and to ensure the public domain grows and thrives. ... Neither copyright nor CC licenses can or should address all of the ways that AI might impact people. There are no easy solutions, but it is clear we need to step outside of copyright to work together on governance, regulatory frameworks, societal norms, and many other mechanisms to enable us to harness AI technologies and practices for good.*\r\n\r\nIn terms of content labelling, there have been several initiatives in this community:\r\n\r\n* [How should AI-generated media be handled?](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:AI-generated_media#How_should_AI-generated_media_be_handled?) section of the Guidance mentioned above;\r\n* [Category:AI-generated images by Commons users](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:AI-generated_images_by_Commons_users);\r\n* [Wikimedia Commons AI/Essay](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons_AI/Essay), part of a rejected [Proposal for a sister project](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Commons_AI) (similar to [WikiAI](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiAI));\r\n* [AI Sauna/AI for Wikimedia Commons](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AI_Sauna/AI_for_Wikimedia_Commons) at a recent community event;\r\n\r\nRecently the [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) video sharing platform, an [early adopter](https://www.heise.de/news/Vimeo-integriert-Creative-Commons-Lizenzen-1037536.html) of CC licenses, [announced](https://vimeo.com/blog/post/vimeos-position-on-ai) new [AI guidelines](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/25551485186833-How-do-I-label-my-videos-to-indicate-they-contain-AI-generated-content), along with a revised [Terms of Service](https://vimeo.com/terms).\r\n\r\n![](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/article_attachments/26477014687505)\r\n\r\n*Image: [Vimeo Help Center](https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/25551485186833-How-do-I-label-my-videos-to-indicate-they-contain-AI-generated-content)*\r\n\r\nA project like this one could also be used to explore critical questions about the way online gigs and microtasking is used for building AI datasets: see [Inside the AI Factory](https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots), and [Are CAPTCHAs used to to train AI?](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-captcha-and-does-google-use-it-to-train-ai)\r\n\r\n![](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/1/071R5NQZFM0DWMTHGU1LEB9J/69316_The_tennis_player_is_Roger_Federer_Swiss_tennis_s_xl1024v10.jpg)\r\n\r\n*This image, and the one in the header, were rendered using Stable DIffusion XL 1.0.*\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to leave a [Comment](215/comment) here with any further links.","maintainer":"loleg","name":"Perceptual Plausibility","phase":"Prototype","progress":30,"score":68,"source_url":"https://github.com/snappy91/Wiglitcher","stats":{"commits":23,"during":39,"people":3,"sizepitch":11203,"sizetotal":12032,"total":53,"updates":49},"summary":"Build a game for classifying images as plausible (human-created) or implausible (machine-generated), that could also be \"played\" by an autonomous agent in order to automatically discern the provenance of content in a GLAM context, such as the images or other content shared on Wikimedia Commons.

Newly developed search features have opened up new possibilities for reuse of Europeana's database. One of those features is the **geospatial search feature**, which allows users to specify a point in space and search within a certain radius around that point. The Search API will return all objects in its database that fall within that search radius and conform to the other query parameters the user has entered. An example of this kind of search is:\r\n\r\n[https://api.europeana.eu/record/search.json?wskey=YOURAPIKEY&query=*&qf=distance(coverageLocation,47,12,2000)&sort=distance%20asc](https://api.europeana.eu/record/search.json?wskey=api2demo&query=*&qf=distance(coverageLocation,47,12,2000)&sort=distance%20asc)\r\n\r\nMore than 17 million Europeana objects are enriched with a latitude and longitude position in one or more of the following fields: *currentLocation*, *coverageLocation* or *location*.

Humap website](https://twin-it.humap.site/map/browse), which shows which 3D models each member state has submitted.*\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**THE CHALLENGE**\r\n\r\nWe at Europeana challenge you to **create a project that in some way leverages the geospatial search feature for storytelling purposes**. What shape this project takes is up to you: you can trace a single object or person throughout history on a map, you might create an app that allows users to search for objects close to their current physical location, or anything else that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nBecause this years' theme is 'On the Move', please think about a project that falls within those parameters. One audience group that loves engaging with cultural heritage in a geo-specific setting is tourists. If your project can **solve an issue the tourism sector has** (e.g. 'what are interesting places near me to visit?' or 'how can I know more about this thing I've just found?') using digital cultural heritage, you're appealing to a huge audience. An interesting subset of our collection to explore for glamhack24 is our Migration Collection. It consists of over 300K cultural heritage objects and can be accessed by using the query parameter 'theme=migration' in the Search API. [example API call](https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?wskey=YOURKEY&query=*&profile=standard&theme=migration).\r\n\r\nAre you looking for more inspiration on what content in Europeana you can reuse to appeal to the theme 'On the Move'? Then check out our stories tagged with 'migration': [https://www.europeana.eu/en/stories?tags=migration](https://www.europeana.eu/en/stories?tags=migration)\r\n\r\nOne of the ways you can nicely visualise your data is by using [Humap](https://humap.me/).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**GET IN TOUCH**\r\n\r\nYou'll be supported during this challenge by Jolan Wuyts, API Outreach coordinator at Europeana, who can help you understand our APIs, curate API calls for you and generally be a mentor and expert on the Europeana database. The rest is up to you and the rest of the team!\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Documentation details**\r\n\r\nYou can find the docs for the europeana Search API here: [https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2385739812/Search+API+Documentation](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2385739812/Search+API+Documentation)\r\n\r\nBelow is an extract from those docs detailing how to use the `distance`, `location`, `CurrentLocation`, `CoverageLocation`, and location sorting parameters:\r\n\r\nWe can filter results by distance using the function `distance` in the parameter `qf`. This example will look for objects with the words `world war` that are located (the object itself or the spatial topic of the resource) in a `distance` of `200` km to the point with latitude `47` and longitude `12`.\r\n\r\nSyntax: `query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)`\r\n\r\n`https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)`\r\n\r\nWe can also use more specific fields instead of `location`: `currentLocation` (with coordinates from `edm:currentLocation`), and `coverageLocation` (with coordinates from `dcterms:spatial` and `dc:coverage`). For example, `qf=distance(currentLocation,47,12,200)` will filter the results to those located within 200 km of the coordinates indicated.\r\n\r\nWhen we refine by distance (i.e., `qf=distance(...)`), we can also include `distance+asc` or `distance+desc` in the sorting parameter in order to rank the results by the distance to the coordinates.\r\n\r\nSyntax: `query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)&sort=distance+asc`\r\n\r\n`https://api.europeana.eu/record/v2/search.json?query=world+war&qf=distance(location,47,12,200)&sort=distance+asc`\r\n\r\nRefinement and sorting parameters can be concatenated. Each such parameter and the mandatory query parameter contributes a breadcrumb object if breadcrumbs are specified in the search profile.\r\n\r\nmore information about the specific content of fields like dcterms:spatial, edm:currentLocation and dc:coverage can be found here: [https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2106294284/edm+ProvidedCHO](https://europeana.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EF/pages/2106294284/edm+ProvidedCHO)\r\n\r\n![IMG 20240907 150912.jpg](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11586/4G06OZR27L58OBCXGHVF2L6D/IMG_20240907_150912.jpg)","maintainer":"jolanwuyts","name":"Getting creative with Europeana","phase":"Sketching","progress":20,"score":52,"source_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pyvHCVLt7LFaxAyxRU2gIesMeJF_p-ocSqHQtUwpTZw/edit?usp=sharing","stats":{"commits":0,"during":15,"people":5,"sizepitch":6214,"sizetotal":6662,"total":36,"updates":30},"summary":"Create a project that leverages the Europeana Search API's new 'distance' search parameter for storytelling purposes.

One of the objects was an unspectacular lump of corroded bronze that proved to be the remains of the world's first known analog computer built in Ancient Greece. The so-called Antikythera Mechanism was a hand-powered model of the solar system used to calculate astronomical cycles and to predict eclipses.\r\n\r\n![1280pxMecanismo de Anticitera 2.JPG](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/5/P34BJKNM1NRIFR5NUJXZ199A/1280pxMecanismo_de_Anticitera_2.JPG)\r\n\r\n**Dials**\r\n\r\n82 individual parts of the Antikythera mechanism have survived, seven large fragments, known as fragments A to G, and 75 smaller fragments, which were simply numbered from 1 to 75. All parts of the mechanism were cut out of a 1 to 2 mm thick bronze sheet. The entire mechanism was originally packed in a wooden frame or box. The extensive and still ongoing reconstruction of the mechanism revealed that it served as a model for the movements of the Sun, the Moon and the planets as observable from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe front of the mechanism contains one large dial. Above and below the dial it contained a so-called parapegma \u2013 a list with the dates of heliacal risings and settings of important stars and constellations. The base of the front dial is a solar calendar. Two ring-shaped scales are part of the dial, an inner zodiac scale and an outer date scale. The inner ring scale was divided into 12 sections for the 12 signs of the zodiac. The outer ring scale was divided into 365 sections for the 365 days of the year according to the Egyptian calendar: 12 months of 30 days each and 5 additional days. The movement of the Sun, the Moon and the 5 planets known at the time \u2013 Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn \u2013 were visualised on the front. The current position of the celestial bodies in the zodiac at a certain point in time could be read off on the front dial. Additionally, the front contained a sphere, which illustrated the current phase of the moon.\r\n\r\n![scales.jpg](https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/5/JK4TYSPVOHQBT7ZM97VEXJ8D/scales.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe back of the mechanism contains two large and three small dials. The basic unit of the two large back dials is the synodic lunar month. The upper large spiral-shaped dial is a lunar calendar which was scaled with the 13 month names of a lunisolar calendar used at the time. When the sun pointer on the front was turned 19 times (19 solar years), 235 synodic months were traversed on the back. This astronomical connection between 19 solar years which equal 235 synodic months with good precision is known as the Metonic cycle. The large upper dial encompasses two smaller dials. The existence of the one on the left side is backed by the discovery of the number 76 in the inscriptions. This led to the assumption that this refers to the 76-solar-year Callippic cycle. The Callippic cycle consists of four Metonic cycles, after which one day had to be skipped in order to realign the solar and lunar time-keeping. The upper right dial is the so-called games dial. It contains the names of several important pan-hellenic feasts such as the Olympiads and of some smaller local ones within a four-year cycle.\r\n\r\nThe lower large spiral-shaped dial on the back is an eclipse calendar which was scaled with 223 synodic lunar months, the so-called Saros period. After 223 synodic lunar months eclipses repeat under similar circumstances. The synodic months in which a solar eclipse and/or a lunar eclipse took place were marked with glyphs. In the current reconstruction the large lower dial encompasses one smaller dial. It is tightly connected with the eclipse calendar \u2013 it extends the eclipse calendar to three times the value of the Saros period. One Saros period has a surplus of about eight hours. After three Saros periods \u2013 one Triple-Saros or Exeligmos \u2013 this surplus adds up to 24 hours and thus one full day. The small Exeligmos dial was divided into three sectors, which indicated whether the time of day indicated on the main scale applied, or whether 1/3 or 2/3 days were to be added.\r\n\r\n**Project**\r\n\r\nThe Antikythera Mechanism project @ https://www.thomasweibel.ch/antikythera/ was a challenge entry for the 10th Swiss Open Cultural Data Hackathon taking place on Sept 6/7 in Lucerne. It aims at providing an accurate and freely accessible VR model for education and study porposes. The project visualizes the mechanism according to the actual findings in the existing fragments, despite plausible speculations proposing additional gearwork also visualizing the movements of the five planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) known at the time.\r\n\r\nThe VR model can be downloaded <a href=\"https://www.thomasweibel.ch/antikythera/antikythera-mechanism4.min.glb\">here</a> (GLB format, 42MB) and viewed <a href=\"https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n**Sources**\r\n\r\n* Almagest, International Journal for the History of Scientific Ideas 2016.1: The Inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism ([https://www.brepolsonline.net/toc/almagest/2016/7/1](https://www.brepolsonline.net/toc/almagest/2016/7/1))\r\n* Aristeidis, V., Christophoros, M., & Andreas, V.

The [Museum Rietberg](https://rietberg.ch/) (MRZ) as well as the [Ethnographic Museum at the UZH](https://www.musethno.uzh.ch/de.html) (VMZ) both have a number of albums with photos mainly ascribed to Sevruguin in their collections. In total there are around 500 photos in these albums.\r\nSince most of the original negatives of Sevruguins burned down in the beginning of the 20. c. it is difficult to reconstruct which photos are actually by Sevruguin and which by other Iranian photographers (for example [Abdullah Qajar (1849\u20131908/1912)](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5946683) or laymen photographers (for example [Ernst Hoelzler (1835\u20131911)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Hoeltzer).\r\nAdding those photos to wikimedia commons could greatly increase the availability for researchers and would expand the already existing [images by Sevruguin](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs_by_Antoin_Sevruguin) on wikimedia commons \u2013 uploaded by other institutions from around the world.\r\nThis challenge for the GLAMhack 24 was about learning about the best practice for GLAMs to upload photos from their collection to Wikimedia Commons, learn about Wikidata, learn about the use of OpenRefine, do a first batch upload, and get in a discussion about the best ways of describing the photos, taking into account the historic descriptions in the albums.\r\nThe members of our group had various backgrounds: Being active in the wikivers for decades, being curators for westasia and photos, coming from documentation or digital humanities.\r\n\r\n## Learning about Wikimedia Commons and the Wikiverse\r\n\r\nA first step was learn about Wikimedia Commons and the Wikiverse in general. Thanks to our longtime wikimedians Diego and Martin, everyone started to understand the distinction between the different sister projects Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, and Wikipedia and how they are connected and enriching each other.\r\nOf course Wikimedia Commons was the focus: We learned how to upload a single (or up to 25) images directly with the Upload Wizard. This way of uploading is what is mainly used wikimedians like Diego and Martin, which also makes sense: Their usecase is to upload only a few images at a time, adding the metadata about the image and the depicted topics manually at the same time as uploading it. This way one has control over the single image, and can really enrich the wikitext and structured data of the few images being uploaded. It is also possible to copy the information of the first image uploaded and use it for the next batch of photos that have the same metadata.\r\nFrom the view of GLAMs this way is maybe to slow and might double the work: usually an institution has a big batch of images (more than 25 at a time) and has already at least some metadata documented in their documentation software which in turn can be exported as an excel. It is here where the process with OpenRefine has the big impact \u2013 for only uploading a few images without already existing metadata it might be too much work.\r\n\r\n## Content consideration\r\n\r\nBefore we actually uploaded images to wikimedia commons, there was also a lively discussion about the content, content warnings as well as titles. These thoughts were specific about the images form Sevruguin, but can be expanded to other images of course as well.\r\n\r\n### Titles\r\n\r\nSince the images of by Sevruguin don't have original titles given by Sevruguin, it was very difficult to come up with a good solutions for the titles. The photographs did have some titles given by the collectors from around 1900, and while these serve as a historical source, the museums don't want to reproduce racial stereotypes and wrong attributions, or at least mark it as a historical naming. This of course is a bigger discussion that is also discussed in different working groups from different swiss institutions. [Here](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/691291) the ETH published guidelines on how they work on problematic titles or descriptions of objects in their collections.\r\nIn the case of the photographs in the collection of the VMZ, we decided to use the title from the album, but also clearly mark it as being a historical attribution:\r\nExample: The legend in the album for [VMZ.523.01.037](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q130250703) was \"Armen. [Armenische] Nonnen in Djoulfa\". For the wikidata item we only used the inventory number as the label, and added a description with the given legend: \"Fotografie von Antoin Sevruguin, Bildunterschrift auf Albumseite: \"Armen. [Armenische] Nonnen in Djoulfa\", aus der Sammlung des VMZ\". In this way, it is clearly marked as being historical. The downside is that the description of the wikidat item is not shown on wikimedia commons, and only the inventory number is given as a title. To counter that we decided to write the same line as a description on wikimedia commons.\r\nThe filename on wikimedia commons was another point of discussion. Since it is very difficult to change afterwards, it needs to be as correct as possible from the start. While in the [guidelines on uploading](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Uploading_media_files_to_a_Wikibase_with_OpenRefine) files with OpenRefine state that it might be helpful to name the files with a more descriptive name, we concluded that it could actually create more problems down the road (as well having the same issues as above). We decided to name it with the inventory number and the name of the creator. But also this turned out to be not a good decision: While working on it, we got the information that one of the photos already uploaded beforehand by the MRZ was wrongly attributed to Sevruguin and is actually shot by another photographer. While the metadata is easy to change, the title will still say \"Sevruguin\".\r\n\r\n### Sensitive Content\r\n\r\nImages can also contain sensitive content, i.e. showing violence or sick and dead people. While there are guidelines on nudity on wikimedia commons, there are no guidelines on images depicting violence. After some discussion we decided to not upload one image of hanged people, even though it can be found on various websites. We don't know if this is the way to go forward, since it hinders a complete overview. Putting an [editorial blur](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/710062) the image could be an option and has been done on various museum collection websites, but we don't know if this could also be solution for wikimedia commons.\r\n\r\n## OpenRefine Process\r\n\r\nDaniela from the VMZ brought with her as a testing file an excel export from the museums database. This excel was a simple export of certain fields without any processing of the data at the time of the export. This is probably the most common case. If it is possible to already prepare the export better, the whole process can get even smoother. The following description is not a full tutorial on OpenRefine, but focusses on the process for GLAMs. There are already some good tutorials online, either on youtube to follow along, or on the [wikiversity](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Uploading_media_files_to_a_Wikibase_with_OpenRefine).\r\nHere is the header of the file, with a sample line (splited in two, due to formatting):\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n| Beschreibung | Anmerkung zur Beschreibung | ist Teil von | Datierung | Zusatz Datierung | Fotograf:in | Material/Technik |\r\n| ------------ | -------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |\r\n| \"Persischer Dorfbewohner\" | handschriftliche Notiz auf Albumseite | Album Iran 1 (VMZ 523.01) | 1880-1900 | ca. | Sevruguin, Antoin | Albuminpapierabzug |\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n| Masse Foto in cm\\_HxB | Land | Ort | Bemerkungen geografische Zuordnung | Bemerkungen zum Objekt | Beschriftungen im/auf Bild |\r\n| -------------------- | ---- | --- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |\r\n| 20 x 13 | Iran |  | fr\u00fcher: Persien |  | 97 |\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis already gives almost all of the necessary information for an upload on wikidata, but a few columns needed to be changed or added. For the purpose of learning to use OpenRefine it was perfect!\r\n\r\n1. Spliting columns: The column \"Datierung\" as well as \"Masse Foto in cm\\_HxB\" needed to be split into two separate columns. This can be done by going to Edit column -> Split into several columns... and then specify the seperator. In this case it was \"-\" for the dating and \" x \" for the dimensions (take note of the extra spaces being part of the seperator!)\r\n2. We could also edit the column which had the content \"fr\u00fcher: Persien\": We learned, that it was actually called \"Qajar Iran\" at the time of Sevruguin. By editing one cell and then clicking on \"Apply to all identical cells\", this was easily done for the whole file.\r\n3. We also changed the column \"Beschreibung\" to the above mentioned longer description. We used Edit cells -> Transform and then added the extra content before and after the existing values: \"Fotografie von Antoin Sevruguin, Bildunterschrift auf Albumseite: \"+value+\", aus der Sammlung des VMZ\".\r\n4. Since the image files were named with the inventory number, but had underscores instead of dots, we already needed to peak a little into [GREL](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/grel), but just a little. We added a new column on the base of the inventory number: Edit Column -> Add Column based on this column. We then replaced the dots by underscores: value.replace('.','\\_')\r\n\r\nThese are the most basic editing tools, and a combination of them will get you very far already! GREL can get you very far, but it also gets very complicated quickly.\r\n\r\n### Reconciling\r\n\r\nReconciling is a way turning your text into links to wikidata. It is also needed to create new entries in wikidata as well as wikimedia commons. Most of the statements of a wikidata item are linking to an other wikidata item, while measurements or dates are not necessary to link, of course.\r\n\r\n1. Reconcile all the columns you want to use for the wikidata item, like \"Material/Technik\", \"Fotograf:in\" or \"Land\", by going to Reconcile -> Start reconciling. It will then ask you to chose which wikibase you want to use, we chose wikidata to create the links to the wikidata items. Sometimes it already recognises a type and suggest to only search for items with that type (for example \"human\" for the column \"Fotograf:in\"), otherwise it just searches all of wikidata. Start reconciling!\r\n2. Matching the links: sometimes (for example for Sevruguin) it found directly the correct wikidata item - the entry in the cell turns blue and by hovering over it you can see a preview of the wikidata item linked. Othertimes, for example with \"Iran\", it finds multiple items which are a close match: you have to choose the correct one. By clicking on the two check marks, you choose it for all the identical cells. There will be a dark green line indicating how many percent of that colunn has been reconciled. If none of the given option is the correct one, you can also search for the correct one.\r\n3. To create new items for each artwork or collection item, you need to have one columns marked for that. The easiest way is to use the column for the label, in this case the \"Inventarnummer\". If you reconcile this column, it wont find any wikidata item to match (hopefully!). it will give you the option to create a new item based on that cell. If you go to Reconcile -> Actions -> Create a new item for each cell you can do that for the whole column. There will be a bright green line indicating that this is the one to create new items.\r\n\r\nBe sure to reconcile all of the data that you need, before you go on to the next stage. If you already building you schema and then change the strucure of the data, OpenRefine has a hard time to update the schema to the new structure. Usually, you have to delete the schema and start anew.\r\n\r\n### Building the schema\r\n\r\nBy going to Extension: Wikibase -> Edit Wikibase Schema the view changes, now it is time to \"build\" the wikidata item. These schemas can be saved \u2013 which is speeding up the process tremendously for any further uploads. if you always have the same export with the same labels, you only need to build the schema once.\r\nBy clicking on \"Add item\" you tell OpenRefine to create a new item. You can then add the column headings to the correct spot: to actually add a new item, the reconciled column where we chose \"create new item\" needs to be added in the top spot. After that you can add terms and add statements. Every wikidata item needs to have a label and a description.

adding statements you can build your wikidata item. There a only a few rules or guidelines on what statements are need. Here is a list of statements that make sense for photos in a collection of a GLAM institute:\r\n\r\n* instance of: should be \"photograph\" (Q125191), carefull to not choose \"photography\" (Q11633)!\r\n* inception: the dating model on wikidata is a bit confusing. Use the overarching century/millenium and add the qualifiers \"earliest date\" and \"latest date\"\r\n* creator\r\n* made from material\r\n* height\r\n* width\r\n* collection\r\n* inventory number: since the inventory number isn't a general fact about the object, it needs the qualifier \"collection\"\r\n* location of creation:\r\n\r\nIf you are not sure if you do it correctly, you can switch to the preview, where it shows you how it will look like.\r\nBy the way: Don't get too confused by many issue that OpenRefine throws at you! There are three kind of issues, and they vary greatly in the severity:\r\n\r\n1. Information: This usually just informs you about something, for example, that you indeed will create items!\r\n2. Warnings: Wikidata loves sources for each statement. In many case, this is not neccessary, or can be added at a later date. You can generally ignore these warnings.\r\n3. Errors: Sometimes there is indeed an error \u2013 you might have forgotten to add a label to a wikidata object. These errors need to be corrected before uploading.\r\n\r\n### Upload to Wikidata\r\n\r\nNow comes to fun and magic part, uploading the data to wikidata. Go to Extensions: Wikibase ->Upload edits to Wikibase. You will need to login again with your credentials. It again shows you all of the issues. Unless there is an Error showing, you can proceed. Give a short summary of you edit, a few words are enough. By clicking on Upload edits OpenRefine goes on to create wikidata items!\r\n\r\n## Wikimedia Commons\r\n\r\nNow we need to switch our minds to wikimedia commons. Many of the processes are the same though!\r\n\r\n### Filepath\r\n\r\nOpenRefine needs to know where your images are, to be able to upload them. If you use [OpenRefine on PAWS](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/OpenRefine#:~:text=OpenRefine%20here.-,Run%20OpenRefine%20on%20PAWS,-%5Bedit%5D), you have to upload them to the PAWS Server first, follow these steps: [Running OpenRefine online](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:OpenRefine/Uploading_files_with_OpenRefine#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20with%20OpenRefine%20on,new%20directory%20for%20your%20files). If you are running OpenRefine locally, you will need absolute file paths. In both cases, you want to create a column with the filepath.\r\nWe tried both versions, and both worked fine, althoug we didn't do a stresstest with thousands of hi-res files. On PAWS, you only have 3 GB of diskspace, so that might limit you eventually.\r\n\r\n### Filename\r\n\r\nOn wikimedia, the filename has to be unique for every file! For GLAMs this can easily be achieved if you put in your inventory number and you institutions name or acronym: for example \"VMZ.523.01.003.jpg\" in our case. We decided to also add the creator name, although as described earlier, this can lead to problems later on and we wouldn't recomend it. In cases of photoalbums, one could use the descripitive title of the album, as the Golestan Palace Library did: \"Golestan Palace Album No. 208-5.jpg\" We haven't yet found any good solution.\r\nThe filename is also the column that we need to reconcile, but now we need to choose wikimedia commons as the wikibase. You need to get no match \u2013 otherwise there is already a file on wikimedia commons with the same file name. As before with the label, we need to choose \"Add new item for each cell\".\r\nWikimedia Commons is not available out of the box as a wikibase, you need to manually add it the first time you use OpenRefine. At Extensions: Wikibase -> Manage Wikibase instances you can choose wikimedia commons and add it easily.\r\n\r\n### Wikitext\r\n\r\nUsually all the information about an image on Commons is stored in wikitext. This has its own syntax and can get quite complex. Every file on wikimedia commons needs to have some wikitext, but if you do the upload this way with wikidata and OpenRefine, the wikitext can be minimalized. There are basically three things that need to be in there:\r\n\r\n1. == {{int:filedesc}} ==\r\n\r\nHere you need to add the template name, in the case of historical photographs, it is {{Art photo}}.\r\n2\\. == \\{\\{int:license\\-header\\}\\} ==\r\nHere you need to state the licence\\, in our case with Sevruguin\\, who died in 1933\\, we can state this like this: \\{\\{PD\\-Art\\|PD\\-old\\-auto\\-expired\\|deathyear=1933\\}\\}\r\n3\\. Adding categories: all images on wikimedia commons need to be in at least one category\\. You need to state them in wikitext\\, or then afterwards with different tools\\. We used for example the following category: \\[\\[Category:Photographs by Antoin Sevruguin\\]\\]\r\nWe found it helpfull to look at uploaded files to see what kind of categories are already in use around that topic.\r\nYou should also add a category called [[Category:Uploaded by {your institution}]], so that you are able to easily track your uploads.\r\nIn the end it might look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== {{int:filedesc}} == {{Art photo}}\r\n== {{int:license-header}} == {{PD-Art|PD-old-auto-expired|deathyear=1933}}\r\n[[Category:Antoin Sevruguin]]\r\n[[Category:Qajar Iran]]\r\n[[Category:Photographs by Antoin Sevruguin]]\r\n[[Category:Black and white photographs by Antoin Sevruguin]]\r\n[[Category:Photographs by Antoin Sevruguin in the collection of V\u00f6lkerkundemuseum der Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich]]\r\n[[Category:Landscape photographs by Antoin Sevruguin]]\r\n[[Category:Architecture photographs by Antoin Sevruguin]]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building the Schema\r\n\r\nNow it is already time to build your schema, this time you need to choose \"Wikimedia Commons\" as your Target Wikibase instance. The other steps are similiar to those above. This time around though, you will add a new item with column for the filename (which includes the file extension!).\r\nAs described above, we added the description as a caption.\r\nThere are some statements required as well. These statements will show up in the structured data on wikimedia commons:\r\n\r\n1. digital representation of: Here you need to add the link to your wikidata item. Since you still working in the same sheet, and already have created the item, you can drag that column here (it was \"Inventarnummer\" in our case). This connects the wikidata item to the image on commons. In theory, an item can have mulitple representations. Think about a 3D-Object, but maybe even a photonegative, which you upload once as thruthful negative, and once as positive.\r\n2. Urheberrechtsstatus\r\n3. Lizenz\r\n\r\n### Uploading\r\n\r\nNow it's time to upload everthing to wikimedia commons. It is the same process as above, but this time it probably will take considerably longer, since it is actually uploading images.\r\n\r\n## Connecting the File to the wikidata item\r\n\r\nAs a last step it is helpful to connect the wikidata item also with the image. This is easy, since you already have everything you need: a column with your wikidata item, and a column with your wikimedia commons file.\r\nJust switch back to wikidata as you Target wikibase instance and add a new item based on the wikidata column. Add the statement \"image\" (P18) and drag the filename column there. Then upload the edits to wikidata!\r\n\r\n## And now?\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you successfully uploaded images on wikimedia commons! These are now available for everyone, and are a valuable resource for researchers around the world.\r\n\r\n### Categorizing: Cat-a-lot\r\n\r\nNow you can start categorize the images even more. Jonas was doing a lot of categorizing during those two days and sorted the already uploaded images by institution, as well as started to sort them by topic: landscape or portrait photography. He used a very handy tool called [Cat-a-lot](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Gadget-Cat-a-lot)\r\n\r\n### Embed on Wikipedia Pages\r\n\r\nYou can now start add the uploaded photos on Wikipedia pages! Enrich Wikipedia by adding those photos any article where it might be relevant. You can do that in any language. But be aware to not add too many \"unneccessary\" images. If an article is very short, adding 10 images makes it unbalanced.\r\n\r\n## Benefits and Statistics\r\n\r\nWhile we were busy uploading, Dominic and Francesca did a lot of Spraql queries around the topic and did some statistics. We tried to figure out how many GLAMs in Switzerland actually worked like this, when it comes to historic photographs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT ?collection ?collectionLabel ?item ?itemLabel ?value ?valueLabel\r\nWHERE {\r\n\u00a0 ?collection wdt:P31 wd:Q1497649.\r\n\u00a0 ?collection wdt:P17 wd:Q39.\r\n\u00a0 ?item wdt:P195 ?collection.\r\n\u00a0 ?item wdt:P31 ?value.\r\n\u00a0 SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language \"[AUTO_LANGUAGE],mul,en\". } # Helps get the label in your language, if not, then default for all languages, then en language\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives a long list of objects in swiss collections with a wikidata item and looks at the type. As it turns out, for historical photographs only the MRZ and the VMZ have been doing it this way. This can have various reasons which would need further research: Is it even neccessary to create a wikidata item for every photograph? But oftentimes, as Diego pointed out, did the institution upload their photographs a longer time ago, when this method was not yet available at all.\r\nBut it does show the benefit of doing it that way: with sparql as a powerfull query language, it makes the images on Wikimedia Commons more easily searchable, beyond the use of categories. By simply adding \"?item wdt:P18 ?pic.\" to the query above, it shows you the images of those items (do add \"LIMIT 100\" add the end of the query!).\r\n\r\n### Geographic References of Swiss and European Collection items\r\n\r\nFrancesca was also interested in geographic references for the WikiData objects in swiss and european GLAM Institutions and created from queried data following maps:\r\n\r\n* Map of objects from [swiss GLAM institutions](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/KDpR6/?v=4) \r\n\r\n\r\n* Maps of objects from european GLAM Insitutions by [depicts (dt. Motiv)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/francesca.altorfer/viz/DEPICTSWikidataObjectsofEuropeanGLAMInstitutionsbydepics/Sheet1) and by [country of origin (dt. Ursprungsland)](https://public.tableau.com/views/WikidataobjectsofEuropeanGLAMInstitutionsbycountryoforigin/Sheet1?:language=de-DE&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)\r\n\r\nThey show an interesting discrepancy between where objects are coming from originally and what places they are depicting. It is clear that there are many european paintings which depict european place uploaded to wikidata. Further research and analysis could be done on this - especially considering that many historical photographs dont have an wikidata item to beginn with. How would this distribution change?\r\n\r\n### Standards for describing collections artworks\r\n\r\nIt would be further interesting to compare how different institutions describe their objects on wikidata. Dominik did start on a complex excel analysis, which did not end fruitful so far. This remains to be done.\r\n\r\n### Github\r\n\r\nYou can also find the same (currently, october 2024) documentation over on github. I might be updating stuff there, and in the meantime, it just sits there as well.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## From before and during the challenge:\r\n\r\n**First Success:**\r\nWe figured out OpenRefine, wikidata and wikimedia commons together to upload the first three images for the Ethnographic Museum of the UZH:\r\n[Photographs by Antoin Sevruguin in the Ethnografic Museum UZH](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Photographs_by_Antoin_Sevruguin_in_the_collection_of_V%C3%B6lkerkundemuseum_der_Universit%C3%A4t_Z%C3%BCrich)\r\n![AntoinSevruguinMadchenineuropaischerundMadcheninpersischerKleidungnebeneinandersitzendMuseumRietberg2022.00428.134.jpg](https://bucketeer-036aa605-c047-4623-8610-f1764b90cf98.s3.amazonaws.com/glamhack/11486/8KRI0UVTPU02JSM2AQ4WRDQA/AntoinSevruguinMadchenineuropaischerundMadcheninpersischerKleidungnebeneinandersitzendMuseumRietberg2022.00428.134.jpg)\r\n\r\nTwo girls in European Persian dress, Antoin Sevruguin (1851-1933), Iran, c. 1880-1896, albumen print, 11.8 \u00d7 16.8 cm, Museum Rietberg Zurich, Emil Alpiger Collection, inv. no. 2022.428.134, gift from the heirs of Emil Alpiger. Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons.\r\n\r\nAntoin Sevruguin (1851\u20131933) was born to Armenian parents in Iran, he grew up in Tiflis (now Tbilisi), Georgia, and later worked in Tehran. His goal was to make a portrait of his native country that was as comprehensive as possible. His oeuvre included around 7,000 photographs. During his lifetime, his photographs were already being published in European books; he was awarded gold medals in Brussels and Paris and in 1900 raised to the nobility by the shah in 1900. Artists in Iran still relate to him today. Many museum all around the world have photographs by Sevruguin in their collections. In Zurich the Ethnografic Museum UZH and the Museum Rietberg each have several albums with a few hundred photographs.\r\n\r\nIn this challenge we want to discover how images from collections can be made accessible on the wikiverse: Together we will find out, what tools can be used and what the best practices are. Maybe we are even putting together a cheat sheet for GLAM institutions or write up detailed instruction? We further explore the use of the images on wikipedia.\r\n\r\nThe challenge is mostly aimed at people from GLAM institutions without an IT background who are interested in how to make their collections accessible through the wikiverse.

Coated with light-sensitive emulsions and exposed in cameras, glass plates produced detailed and sharp images, revolutionizing photography by allowing for greater precision and clarity. However, the process was labor-intensive and required careful handling of the fragile glass plates.\r\n\r\n**Glassplattensammlung Zug**\r\n\r\nThe Bibliothek Zug houses over 3600 of these plates, known as the \"Glasplattensammlung Zug.\" This collection captures a diverse array of scenes, including architectural landmarks, scenic landscapes, and everyday life moments. Due to the fragility of these glass plates and their archival confinement, presenting these captivating photographs to the public was a significant challenge in the past.\u00a0Utilizing advanced digitization techniques, the Bibliothek Zug partnered with Memoriav to digitize the collection and georeference approximately 2500 photographs from the late 19th century to the 1950s. About half of these images were taken in the Canton of Zug, with a notable concentration in and around the city of Zug.\r\n\r\n**Challenge**\r\n\r\nWith the [photos accessible on the Zentralgut website](https://zentralgut.ch/glasplatten_zug/), the Bibliothek Zug aims to bring the collection to a broader audience through the development of a mobile app. This app will notify users when they are near a location where one of the georeferenced photos from the \"Glasplattensammlung Zug\" was taken, offering a unique and immersive way to explore the region's history.

De Saussure realized that the blue value reflects the amount of water (or pollution) in the air: The bluer the sky, the less vapor or particles, the whiter, the more. De Saussure applied the shades of blue with watercolor to a total of 52 strips of paper, which he glued to a wooden or cardboard ring, from white, which de Saussure labeled \"0\", through all shades of blue to black which had the value \"52\". The deepest blue de Saussure measured himself was 39 degrees on the summit of Mont Blanc in 1787.\r\n\r\nThe instrument itself seems simple, but its sophistication lies in the calibration leading to a set of equidistant color shades. De Saussure used to give away self-made cyanometers to scientist friends whom he encouraged to measure the blue of the sky in as many different places of the world as possible. In fact, young Alexander von Humboldt carried such a cyanometer with him in 1802 when he climbed the 6263-metre-high Chimborazo in Ecuador, which was considered the highest mountain on earth at the time. When von Humboldt reached the summit the weather cleared, revealing the darkest blue ever measured up to that point: 46 degrees on the cyanometer.\r\n\r\nThe Cyanometer project @ https://www.thomasweibel.ch/cyanometer/ provides a freely available copy of the instrument.\r\n\r\n**Usage**\r\n\r\nLaunch Cyanometer on your smartphone and grant access to the camera. Turn away from the sun, point the center to the sky and adjust the color using the red slider. The number indicates the current shade of blue. A normal, clear midday sky at sea level will be around 23 degrees.\r\n\r\n**Sources**\r\n\r\n* Barry, R. G. (1978). H.-B. de Saussure: the first mountain meteorologist.

By means of this international cooperation project, we intend to tell the story of the Habsburg from the point of view of the various populations concerned.

The resulting creations (presentable on a screen) would then be integrated in a website and included in installations to be displayed at Habsburg memory sites in the participating countries, juxtaposing the different perspectives in a modular fashion.

In some cases, a central collection catalog will need to be created from scratch, based on existing documents or the physical organization of the collection (no. 1 in the figure).</li></ol><p>Best Practice:Digitize existing (analog) catalogs in order to be able to link the entries in the digital catalog to earlier versions of the catalog (sources). Example:\u00a0<a class=\"c10\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ville-ge.ch/meg/sql/musinfo_public.php?id%3DK002091&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726062863845837&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pKpOxcZPgKwXDtTRJ8f3i\">Collection catalog of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019ethnographie de Gen\u00e8ve</a>\u00a0(see the links to the historical catalogs at the bottom of the page).</p><p></p><p></p><ol><li>Given the fact that catalogs of ethnographic collections often contain only very little information about the artifacts and the information available may be of dubious quality, it is important to provide photographs of collection artifacts alongside the catalog information. Consequently, existing photographs need to be digitized or new photographs need to be taken (no. 2).</li></ol><p></p><p>Best Practice:</p><p></p><p>When taking new photographs of artifacts, make sure to secure sufficient usage rights to the photographs to (later) be able to release the high-resolution images online under a free copyright license.(provide a sample contract\u2026)\u00a0</p><p></p><h2 id=\"h.12xrmw8xngf2\">Phase 2: Facilitating Access</h2><p>An important next step is to make the collection catalog available online (no. 3). Depending on the maturity level of the database, this can be done in various forms. As a rule, it is more useful to make the existing catalog available online now than to wait until it can be done in the perfect format .</p><p></p><p>Thus, for example, the publication of the catalog in PDF format as an intermediate solution (example: <a class=\"c10\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.mkb.ch/en/museum/sammlung/bestandeslisten.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1726062863847408&amp;usg=AOvVaw1uVceA334wlqkzKMVizaAR\">Inventory Lists of Museum der Kulturen Basel</a>) provides for better online access than would the decision not to publish exports from the current collection database and to wait for the acquisition and roll-out of an online collection database instead.</p><p></p><p>Best Practices:</p><p></p><ul><li>Provide images alongside the text information contained in the collection database.</li><li>The images should have the highest resolution (legally) possible, in order to maximize their usefulness.</li><li>The entry for each artifact should have its own persistent identifier; persistent identifiers should be dereferenceable (i.e. an URI consisting of a standard path and the persistent identifier should return the description of the artifact in the online catalog). </li><li>Artifacts should be findable in the collection database when a user enters the persistent identifier in the search interface.</li><li>The landing page of the catalog should be referenced in Wikidata by means of a P8768 (online catalog URL) statement.\u00a0 </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p>In addition, the institution should signal its readiness to respond to and to engage with potential re-users of the data. This can be done by different means, e.g.:</p><p></p><ul><li>Indicate an address and a method by which high-resolution images of collection artifacts can be obtained and ensure an efficient process for doing so.</li><li>Advertise the catalog and digital images in the context of hackathons to encourage their re-use.</li><li>Advertise the catalog, digital images, and further information about the collection in the context of a Wikipedia edit-a-thon.</li></ul><p>Best Practices:</p><p></p><ul><li>Provide pointers to competent experts that can provide potential re-users of the data with additional information about the collection or individual artifacts.</li></ul><p></p><p>Example Case: Mus\u00e9e d\u2019ethnographie de Gen\u00e8ve </p><h2 id=\"h.8ynkroqeexav\">Phase 3: Facilitating Re-use</h2><p>Re-use of data and digitized artifacts can be facilitated using several strategies:</p><p></p><ol><li>If the rights situation (copyright, personal rights, collective rights of the communities concerned) allows for it, digitized artifacts should be made available online under a free copyright license in the highest quality possible.

Many tourists but also many locals do not know that there used to be a third wooden footbridge called Hofbr\u00fccke, built in the 13th century. It was the longest of the three bridges and was adorned with framed triangular paintings like the other two. The paintings on the Hofbr\u00fccke depict events from the Old and New Testament of the Bible. The Hofbr\u00fccke connected the city with the collegiate church of St. Leodegar, the Hofkirche. When the bridge was demolished in the 19th century, the paintings were stored in magazines or used as art objects in public buildings. After the fire on the Kapellbr\u00fccke in 1993, the city of Lucerne took backup photographs of the Hofbr\u00fccke paintings. Some paintings are no longer traceable. The numbers attached to the images belong to image inventories created at different times by different people. The differences in numbering can therefore be explained by different cycle interpretations.\r\n\r\n**Challenge**\r\n\r\nThe City Archives of Lucerne invites you to help create a virtual tour where people can experience a walk on the Hofbr\u00fccke with its paintings, the view over the city, the lake and the alpine panorama. For this simulation, you can use the photographs of the paintings, which are accessible on the ZentralGut website: [Br\u00fcckenbilder Hofbr\u00fccke - ZentralGut](https://zentralgut.ch/Brueckenbilder_Hofbruecke_Luzern/). A picture gallery with paintings and constructional drawings of the bridge and its immediate surroundings is on the website of the City Archives of Lucerne: [Stadt Luzern - Zeitlicher Br\u00fcckenschlag: Virtueller Gang \u00fcber die Hofbr\u00fccke](https://www.stadtluzern.ch/dokumentebilder/bildergalerien/detail/43246). These pictures shall help visualising where the bridge was located, how it looked, and how it integrated into the cityscape.","maintainer":"","name":" Stroll on a Demolished Medieval Wooden Bridge","phase":"Challenge","progress":0,"score":2,"source_url":"","stats":{"commits":0,"during":0,"people":2,"sizepitch":2257,"sizetotal":2303,"total":8,"updates":6},"summary":"Create a virtual walking tour on the Hofbr\u00fccke","team":"PiaGemperle, SelinaOdermatt","team_count":2,"updated_at":"2024-09-05T19:56","url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/216","webpage_url":"https://s3.dribdat.cc/glam/c/11594/AVDA3W5O7VFD7WCEQ8QK6I2G/Pr\u00e4sentation_Hofbr\u00fccke.pdf"},{"autotext":"","autotext_url":"","category_id":"","category_name":"","contact_url":"","created_at":"2024-09-02T06:28","download_url":"","event_name":"GLAMhack 2024","event_url":"https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/event/12","excerpt":"Stiftung f\u00fcr Kunst, Kultur und Geschichte (SKKG) in Winterthur has a collection of about 300 crossbows from Switzerland, Germany, other Europen countries, and worldwide.

Join us on an interactive journey to connect all the dots between collections, resources, ideas and experiments, generated with over 10 years of OpenGLAM events in Switzerland, ready for the next 10+. Using data from the open source platforms that are evolving through every GLAMhack, we render an immersive visualization of the places, people and projects we have sparked over the years. Dive deep into the digital waters of Lake Lucerne, to explore the past, and imagine the future of our dynamic, caring and optimistic data culture!**\r\n\r\n##### Technical info\r\n\r\nProjects launched at Open Cultural Data Hackathons (GLAMhack) over the years since 2015 have been published on various parts of the Web. We have collected them all into the database of Dribdat, the API of which is at [hack.glam.opendata.ch/about](http://hack.glam.opendata.ch/about)\u00a0and will be made available soon as Data Package on Opendata.swiss. Using THREE.js and Theater.js, the data points are rendered as a generative animation, which portrays the projects and the people behind them in a whimsical way. Using [map data from swisstopo](https://shop.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/free-geodata), we can see the all the places around Switzerland where these ideas took shape. As audio track, we plan to play sound bytes from [Infoclio 10 year](https://infoclio.ch/de/glamhack24-anniversary-edition-last-call-participate)\u00a0video gallery, on top of public domain recordings ([example 1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/60&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726419847090964&usg=AOvVaw0thd6ZXoZPLnhAsufo3fxi), [example 2](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/126&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726419847091139&usg=AOvVaw3XLi3fkYCm9iExdB0XPEln), [example 3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/132&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726419847091325&usg=AOvVaw19bQKljKKB0rLS5I-F1qYB)) \u00a0that were used in GLAMhack projects.
