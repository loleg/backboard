# Backboard

This is a single page application (SPA) that visualizes data from `hackathon.json`, [Frictionless Data](https://frictionlessdata.io), or the [Dribdat API](https://dribdat.cc). 

Features:

- Projects and challenges are shown for a specific event.
- Flexible configuration options can be used for displaying and sorting the results.
- Seamlessly navigate using your mouse or keyboard between individual projects.
- You can also show presentations in full screen mode, use a mouse, keyboard or clicker to navigate through the slides. 
- A subtle countdown timer bar is shown at the bottom of the screen to alert your presenters of the time available. 
- Stylish countdown clock and all the event details can be enabled, for a quick loading home page for your event.

The Backboard has minimal formatting, tight margins, and is ideal for embedding into your webpage anonuncing the upcoming event or results. If you are developing a Vue.js app, you can import the Challenges, Honeycomb and Preview components into your app.

Currently most functions link back to Dribdat, for example, when you click on the Join team button you get directed to the main web application. The long-term goal is to create a more modern, decoupled frontend for Dribdat.

Because it works like a static website, you can bundle the Data Package along with this app or point to a permalink location where you have uploaded your `datapackage.json` for archiving the event.

**Tip:** You may want to enable *Challenges* and *Previews* (opens a modal dialog with swipable navigation) through clicking the `options` button found at the footer of the page (which opens a configuration menu). 
Use the handy *Share* link to get a URL with your config.

**Demo:** https://backboard.vercel.app/

## Installation

Deploy this application with any service that supports Node.js 

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/git/external?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdribdat%2Fbackboard)

Set up app options at the bottom of the page, then click the Share button, and paste the query string (everything after ?&) into your `VUE_APP_DEFAULT_OPTS` variable.

## Usage

This app currently only works if you have data already available. In the future this may well change - see [json.everyhack.day](https://json.everyhack.day).
For now, we recommend one of the following:

- Use the `VUE_APP_DRIBDAT_URL` configured with a link to your dribdat event, or the URL to a Data Package.

Or:

- Put a `datapackage.json` file that you exported from dribdat's Admin, Reports page, or API into the **public** folder - e.g. `.../api/event/current/datapackage.json`
- Optionally, also put a `activity.json` file with an export of the Dribs data from the API - e.g. `.../api/event/current/activity.json?limit=500`

You can use the following environment variables:

- `VUE_APP_DRIBDAT_URL` (required) - fully qualified link to your [Dribdat](https://dribdat.cc) event, or online hosted Data Package (\* see examples)
- `VUE_APP_DRIBS_URL` - as above, a link to the export of the Dribdat Activity API.
- `VUE_APP_DEFAULT_OPTS` - the default display settings - copy the part after ? from the Share link.
- `VUE_APP_HIDE_TOOLBAR` - makes the options toolbar in the footer unavailable.
- `VUE_APP_VOTE_FORM_URL` - link to a form where you are collecting votes or feedback, otherwise the Dribs Post feature will be used.
- `VUE_APP_TIMER_LENGTH` - in minutes, how long the countdown timer should run for in presentation mode (0 to disable, 3 is the default).
- `BACKBOARD_ROOT` - if your deployment is not at the root, change it here (e.g. `/backboard`)
